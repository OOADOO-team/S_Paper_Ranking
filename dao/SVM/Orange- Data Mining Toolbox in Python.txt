name: Orange: Data Mining Toolbox in Pythonurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/285018297_Orange_Data_Mining_Toolbox_in_Pythonpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: J. Dem≈°ar,Tomaz Curk,Ales Erjavec,abstract: Summary: Orange is a machine learning and data mining suite for data analysis through Python scripting and visual programming. Here we report on the scripting part, which features interactive data analysis and component-based assembly of data mining procedures. In the selection and design of components, we focus on the flexibility of their reuse: our principal intention is to let the user write simple and clear scripts in Python, which build upon C$++$ implementations of computationally-intensive tasks. Orange is intended both for experienced users and programmers, as well as for students of data mining.citations_number: 157Citation: A Practical Evaluation of Information Processing and Abstraction Techniques for the Internet of Things http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c810d19dceeb0cbe8499254edc2ae239An overview of free software tools for general data mining http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8d90b07d69375d09e26a616c86feceddUsing Coherence Analysis to Characterize Self-Regulated Learning Behaviours in Open-Ended Learning Environments. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=be5c65276b60f46aebcb3de392db876bGenome-Wide Localization Study of Yeast Pex11 Identifies Peroxisome\u2013Mitochondria Interactions through the ERMES Complex http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d712958e686b5cafce7a44c6abe3034cThree-dimensional textural features of conventional MRI improve diagnostic classification of childhood brain tumours http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=89129bca6908ec0ea58b3845a0ff385cA conserved core of PCD indicator genes discriminates developmentally and environmentally induced programmed cell death in plants. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0e8ef6834c7d8ec686d50ee6ccdf10eeA spiking neural network model of self-organized pattern recognition in the early mammalian olfactory system http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=af9d46d692aa199a18b88ab3ea6efd87An integrated 3-dimensional genome modeling engine for data-driven simulation of spatial genome organization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=72e849cfc4e5905a58c9a9b096e082d8Discerning the differential molecular pathology of proliferative middle ear lesions using Raman spectroscopy http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3625c28cac1545e4aa7c87deb9a44b92References: Matplotlib: A 2D Graphics Environment http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6f5ce6f0f5b81f025ae8b4c4dc548d57An updated set of basic linear algebra subprograms (BLAS) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9749d0b3576dcd4f8c7ea58cbb5e569aLearning scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=79904ded8a457c2ea687a076f72de459Learning scikit-learn : machine learning in Python http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6e87eafc2fabc8446426a233f9f9a936
