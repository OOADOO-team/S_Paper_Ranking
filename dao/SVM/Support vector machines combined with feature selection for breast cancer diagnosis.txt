name: Support vector machines combined with feature selection for breast cancer diagnosisurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417408000912public_in: Elsevierauthors: Mehmet Fatih Akay,abstract: Breast cancer is the second largest cause of cancer deaths among women. At the same time, it is also among the most curable cancer types if it can be diagnosed early. Research efforts have reported with increasing confirmation that the support vector machines (SVM) have greater accurate diagnosis ability. In this paper, breast cancer diagnosis based on a SVM-based method combined with feature selection has been proposed. Experiments have been conducted on different training-test partitions of the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset (WBCD), which is commonly used among researchers who use machine learning methods for breast cancer diagnosis. The performance of the method is evaluated using classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and confusion matrix. The results show that the highest classification accuracy (99.51%) is obtained for the SVM model that contains five features, and this is very promising compared to the previously reported results.citations_number: 301Citation: Short term wind speed prediction based on evolutionary support vector regression algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0fbc30c596b1044588b172fe1773a279Machine learning applications in cancer prognosis and prediction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=93d49381c345242fa1572bacb0b34e1bA hybrid-forecasting model based on Gaussian support vector machine and chaotic particle swarm optimization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6db53b45cab25743c37d086dc8aa90afUsing support vector machines with a novel hybrid feature selection method for diagnosis of erythemato-squamous diseases http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2f7e7b1de471e7b7fe379e931cfef676Computer-aided detection\/diagnosis of breast cancer in mammography and ultrasound: a review. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c2895404f64922f26073320bcc42a2aeWBCD breast cancer database classification applying artificial metaplasticity neural network http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9a386d4f5d7b72cc7ee1c7694173b241Multivariate classification of social anxiety disorder using whole brain functional connectivity http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8cbb7e4c42d693138c7f858a2ea7cc8aBreast cancer diagnosis based on feature extraction using a hybrid of K-means and support vector machine algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8213b0f5dd172cff39119f44014d0213Computer-aided breast cancer detection using mammograms: a review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=55c1fbf1bdad35b90eba176c4ebb674eMammoSys: A content-based image retrieval system using breast density patterns. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=726e828a985a733c097f2657fbdf0071References: Comparing Support Vector Machines with Gaussian Kernels to Radial Basis Function Classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=aebd67933e2ab7a3926a004c60680351Support vector machines for 3D object recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=76fd15b78fe8f7371c33c57f8e32fd00Neural networks for classification: a survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=56217e2c7ef5162138e51b0d9458a3abNeural networks for classification of 2-D patterns http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ea7adfbb2c956a238cf6827a524390c8Combining SVMs with Various Feature Selection Strategies http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e44829df3b3ef501e17aadf45a67cb22Combining SVMs with Various Feature Selection Strategies http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=26cd4b9d7bc2cf3ffd3b29b9f1cc9966Support vector machines for speaker verification and identification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c58e141af56b102f51a30d6c8a5e86c2Obtaining interpretable fuzzy classification rules from medical data. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=13932372d27b1c2609d3b22bea8cb1c4Feature Selection for Support Vector Machines by Means of Genetic Algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1ed96aaa6397621c8ca7e0a91d785e15A fuzzy-genetic approach to breast cancer diagnosis. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0754d301586793753c70e75def281edeSupervised fuzzy clustering for the identification of fuzzy classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3898675f4ab0357a0cac89e7bf0ac4cbSupervised fuzzy clustering for the identification of fuzzy classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f02cff47992babf7762eabba91844009Breast cancer diagnosis using least square support vector machine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d802d6547d6a64ec1a5d4ee30e91ece4Breast cancer diagnosis using least square support vector machine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=65284953f64872f853d59c6ee9b2a8edGenerating concise and accurate classification rules for breast cancer diagnosis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5bae1af07c32b9b5d3c5ebdc72772ed7Ensemble strategies for a medical diagnostic decision support system: A breast cancer diagnosis application http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1c3c3da1cf36fb1cb3ec8fbfb9c10544Two applications of the LSA machine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b4e6c8f689bc16268c70d71db16a503cNeural networks for classification: a survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d4cdd4ce18ab53cc695ecb9876846e81
