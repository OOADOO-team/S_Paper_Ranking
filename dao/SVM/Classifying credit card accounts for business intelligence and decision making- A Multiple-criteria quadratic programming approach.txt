name: Classifying credit card accounts for business intelligence and decision making: A Multiple-criteria quadratic programming approachurl: http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0219622005001775public_in: World Scientific Publishingauthors: YONG SHI,YI PENG,GANG KOU,abstract: A major challenge in credit card portfolio management is to classify and predict credit cardholders&#039; behaviors in a reliable precision because cardholders&#039; behaviors are rather dynamic in nature. This is crucial for creditors because it allows them to take proactive actions and minimize charge-off and bankruptcy losses. Although the methods used in the area of credit portfolio management have improved significantly, the demand for alternative and sophisticated analytical tools is still strong. The objective of this paper is to propose a multiple criteria quadratic programming (MCQP) to classify credit card accounts for business intelligence and decision making. MCQP is intended to predict credit cardholders&#039; behaviors from a nonlinear perspective that is justifiable because both the objective functions and constraints in credit card accounts classification may be nonlinear. Using a real-life credit card dataset from a major US bank, the MCQP method is compared with popular and similar classification methods: linear discriminant analysis, decision tree, multiple criteria linear programming, support vector machine, and neural network. The results indicate that MCQP is a promising business intelligence method in credit card portfolio management.citations_number: 128Citation: PI3K inhibition results in enhanced HER signaling and acquired ERK dependency in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0171baa0515b5d1fa00236476d7452b5A DESCRIPTIVE FRAMEWORK FOR THE FIELD OF DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1244bb01c07c5dca8e1fff47bb7edae2A Multi-criteria Convex Quadratic Programming model for credit data analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d95e6022d59318510107122dd4610da4Recent advances on support vector machines research http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=98b185fc2923874069d364c0f58adb79A VIKOR-BASED MULTIPLE CRITERIA DECISION METHOD FOR IMPROVING INFORMATION SECURITY RISK http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a22285646d85a5cab1ab5d5751d44e43Selection of construction enterprises management strategy based on the SWOT and multi-criteria analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2f940332cfd86fe3f521a921bfa5fb29The IGF pathway regulates ER\u00ce\u00b1 through a S6K1-dependent mechanism in breast cancer cells http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bfd9f0d214cc751bbbb75875a4fe73f9Credit card churn forecasting by logistic regression and decision tree http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7da5b158f99864cc7674801697262252Targeting Insulin and Insulin-Like Growth Factor Signaling in Breast Cancer http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a8c0148dee4bda7a80da43a06d08f263Social influence on the use of Clinical Decision Support Systems: Revisiting the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology by the fuzzy DEMATEL te... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3d2d2a293eeb06113173a56bd21f78afReferences: A class of solutions for group decision problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cb59141e9a9f1829d78ad3696b144c6bMathematical Programming for Data Mining: Formulations and Challenges http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=22891914b9556cc2173dad0f657cc1c2Multivariate statistical analysis: A conceptual introduction (2nd ed.). http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b488203d3fe184a124e6b405cff66742Simple but powerful goal programming models for discriminant problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2409a8273ab91dae2046b5eea1ef213eQuantitative Methods in Credit Management: A Survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=993b9fe85402cb5bc648771761140cecDATA MINING VIA MULTIPLE CRITERIA LINEAR PROGRAMMING: APPLICATIONS IN CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f2acbf27d8aa000ae10ef1f8ec1ca1f7Applications and Implementation : A LINEAR PROGRAMMING APPROACH TO THE DISCRIMINANT PROBLEM http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3f35188148e5f5626ebcdcbdd090b11cImproved Linear Programming Models for Discriminant Analysis * http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=83d6a8d04404544121a64c38601b2fd4Data Mining in Credit Card Portfolio Management: A Multiple Criteria Decision Making Approach http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=daaeca5672b71e66ee30e9a297a8843eMultiple Criteria Linear Programming Approach to Data Mining : Models, Algorithm Designs and Software Development http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ac84c2ac4ecfa8d007c3fb788b6931dfProblems in applying discriminant analysis in credit scoring models http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=98d0184c4d7b8fc3f084280baa1ccf23A Robust Credit Screening Model Using Categorical Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=af277f84585a83fce4be01edd52bc670Multiple Criteria Decision Making in the New Millennium http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9eb9228052af9f064c4f0be2641675bbCredit cards scoring with quadratic utility functions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f994212b65f25d3dab028a7952630fe4Data mining via support vector machines. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f93bb69f3bdd7e06e52f4c9362a3be79Quantitative Methods in Credit Management: A Survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c451d4d4bfc7d2d5990835fb0f9793be
