name: Efficient Object Category Recognition Usingurl: http://www.springerlink.com/content/800852076p3467j2public_in: Springerauthors: Lorenzo Torresani,Martin Szummer,Andrew W. Fitzgibbon,abstract: Summary: We introduce a new descriptor for images which allows the construction of efficient and compact classifiers with good accuracy on object category recognition. The descriptor is the output of a large number of weakly trained object category classifiers on the image. The trained categories are selected from an ontology of visual concepts, but the intention is not to encode an explicit decomposition of the scene. Rather, we accept that existing object category classifiers often encode not the category per se but ancillary image characteristics; and that these ancillary characteristics can combine to represent visual classes unrelated to the constituent categoriesâ€™ semantic meanings. The advantage of this descriptor is that it allows object-category queries to be made against image databases using efficient classifiers (efficient at test time) such as linear support vector machines, and allows these queries to be for novel categories. Even when the representation is reduced to 200 bytes per image, classification accuracy on object category recognition is comparable with the state of the art (36\% versus 42\%), but at orders of magnitude lower computational cost.citations_number: 391Citation: Iterative quantization: A procrustean approach to learning binary codes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d559bdeddef84423fec6393a656d17aeUnsupervised discovery of mid-level discriminative patches http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=384a9a89583bfeca96eabf3ce907beb4Unsupervised Discovery of Mid-Level Discriminative Patches http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=30116538f5bab7fd1166f73848fab926Unsupervised Discovery of Mid-Level Discriminative Patches http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b40fa2d2bf290885d285ed7cf775e2f0Attribute-based classification for zero-shot visual object categorization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=40d9c2cc79780cbbe17a602328d47c19Attribute-Based Classification for Zero-Shot Visual Object Categorization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3d750a12d92199db3441fc68de8fa74fNeural Codes for Image Retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6c05ed933dfe6fd2b887acaf714cad04Sketch Tokens: A Learned Mid-level Representation for Contour and Object Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=02a1794ae6be461c9c7b04fcd6cbd190High-dimensional signature compression for large-scale image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3df6ddf9fa557e8b3ac84d18f6a14cceHigh-dimensional signature compression for large-scale image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3c58ed3ead66cbe62b6b971084b39b4aReferences: Scalable Recognition with a Vocabulary Tree http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e1cf12b547d68e367b3fc247e23cb2edScalable Recognition with a Vocabulary Tree http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=27cf82166eeda9f8740964ea60d84858An Affine Invariant Interest Point Detector http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8c60de8776f2948ba38163d1174fd939Hamming Embedding and Weak Geometric Consistency for Large Scale Image Search http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=75e175ea3e7300358f6f8921111cbf0aDescribing objects by their attributes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6f993bbdcacce007c7e49f8fae8f6cf6Learning to detect unseen object classes by between-class attribute transfer http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=80a762e1901f08efd29c4d6d1942ebd9Learning To Detect Unseen Object Classes by Between-Class Attribute Transfer http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=861afa003748bf47dadb2fe3a015fd4eIn defense of Nearest-Neighbor based image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=efadc2516d5ed8d8fd4b338b622c75ebSemantic texton forests for image categorization and segmentation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1f4f20148f258caebe88ae2cd99bdd6f
