name: Application of SVM and ANN for intrusion detectionurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305054804000711public_in: Elsevierauthors: Wun-Hwa Chen, Sheng-Hsun Hsu, Hwang-Pin Shen,abstract: The popularization of shared networks and Internet usage demands  increases attention on information system security, particularly on intrusion detection. Two data mining methodologies-Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and two encoding methods-simple frequency-based scheme and  tftimes idf  scheme are used to detect potential system intrusions in this study. Our  results show that SVM with  tftimes idf scheme achieved  the best performance, while ANN with simple frequency-based scheme  achieved the worst. The data used in experiments are BSM audit data from  the DARPA 1998 Intrusion Detection Evaluation Program at MIT&#039;s Lincoln  Labs.
