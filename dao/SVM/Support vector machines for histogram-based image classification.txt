This paper shows that support vector machines (SVM&#039;s) can generalize well on difficult image classification problems where the only features are high dimensional histograms, Heavy-tailed RBF kernels of the form K(x,y) = e(-rho)Sigma(i) \x(i)(a) - y(i)(a)\(b) with a less than or equal to 1 and b less than or equal to 2 are evaluated on the classification of images extracted from the Corel stock photo collection and shown to far outperform traditional polynomial or Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernels. Moreover, we observed that a simple remapping of the input x(i) --&gt; x(i)(a) improves the performance of linear SVM&#039;s to such an extend that it makes them, for this problem, a valid alternative to RBF kernels.citations_number: 1690Citation: The 2005 PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ef2de41cfd916b79dfba868b8c80f6c9Local Features and Kernels for Classification of Texture and Object Categories: A Comprehensive Study http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=91a7db8cacd9398a1c9d764a9385b7ffSpectral grouping using the Nystr\u00f6m method http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=66c08e573a3b62da3e3a3af308021d8bClassification using intersection kernel support vector machines is efficient http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=20e99a5a65c74f9bc426372844dfd5ebSupport Vector Machines: Theory and Applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=be865e23f2cfc49e299dc71c30e57f28Support Vector Machines: Theory and Applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=77aa80111657f84192adc8396db9589bCPMC: Automatic Object Segmentation Using Constrained Parametric Min-Cuts http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c8999cadb24afdd3b774e212e0b6d2a8A novel kernelized fuzzy C-means algorithm with application in medical image segmentation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=70a5e20dcc166d1576c380f223e8a51eReferences: An improved training algorithm for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=139c8d7a401089d7e94702e27cad2875Support vector machines for 3D object recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=76fd15b78fe8f7371c33c57f8e32fd00Color- and Texture-Based Image Segmentation Using EM and Its Application to Content-Based Image Retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a6b06ae225f9d552cf041f6892edf966Indexing via color histograms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d6f9468e6d88cdb588de0d30c82427dbProbabilistic Object Recognition Using Multidimensional Receptive Field Histograms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=05908a76a90f8e0c6aca74bdbfe2ed6aGeneralization performance of support vector machines and other pattern classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=483c1dbe910babed6effd86c2b8828dbProbabilistic Object Recognition Using Multidimensional Receptive Field Histograms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5647341e1fa7e705905373261a727d77Comparison of view-based object recognition algorithms using realistic 3D models http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4fe318e799a609f44a3f958eff64dc5cIndexing via Color Histograms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8d177003c742678a066eb4f10a407ef4
