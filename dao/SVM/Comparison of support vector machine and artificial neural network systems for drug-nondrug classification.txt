name: Comparison of support vector machine and artificial neural network systems for drug/nondrug classificationurl: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14632437public_in: NCBIauthors: Byvatov E,Fechner U,Sadowski J,abstract: Abstract Support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) systems were applied to a drug/nondrug classification problem as an example of binary decision problems in early-phase virtual compound filtering and screening. The results indicate that solutions obtained by SVM training seem to be more robust with a smaller standard error compared to ANN training. Generally, the SVM classifier yielded slightly higher prediction accuracy than ANN, irrespective of the type of descriptors used for molecule encoding, the size of the training data sets, and the algorithm employed for neural network training. The performance was compared using various different descriptor sets and descriptor combinations based on the 120 standard Ghose-Crippen fragment descriptors, a wide range of 180 different properties and physicochemical descriptors from the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) package, and 225 topological pharmacophore (CATS) descriptors. For the complete set of 525 descriptors cross-validated classification by SVM yielded 82% correct predictions (Matthews cc = 0.63), whereas ANN reached 80% correct predictions (Matthews cc = 0.58). Although SVM outperformed the ANN classifiers with regard to overall prediction accuracy, both methods were shown to complement each other, as the sets of true positives, false positives (overprediction), true negatives, and false negatives (underprediction) produced by the two classifiers were not identical. The theory of SVM and ANN training is briefly reviewed.citations_number: 390Citation: Frequent Substructure-Based Approaches for Classifying Chemical Compounds http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5738b95727ddc59d86a47dd76747c78fMolecular similarity: a key technique in molecular informatics. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=26167ae44ea6756bf2658f1314dbab91Drug-target interaction prediction from chemical, genomic and pharmacological data in an integrated framework http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=54354e94f716b7829948a31dbd5b4c14Protein-ligand interaction prediction: an improved chemogenomics approach. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5c9ad6ee83a3d114488ce2c99537ed92Molecular similarity and diversity in chemoinformatics: from theory to applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a75d1683bf92cabb66049c7be7457cf5Molecular similarity and diversity in chemoinformatics: From theory to applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=015db5f7da9c504fc71fde17810cf7c3Medicinal chemistry and the molecular operating environment (MOE): application of QSAR and molecular docking to drug discovery. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0745893fdc93924f7f713870470ff77cApplications of 2D descriptors in drug design: a DRAGON tale. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=224742657211e9048adf673ab90cfe40New methodologies for ligand-based virtual screening. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e1df2482b404ce07eae4358bf851f326Automated classification of bird and amphibian calls using machine learning: A comparison of methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c83d960ce8a33061173ac7dc54bf8336References: Training feedforward networks with the Marquardt algorithm http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a571afd77815778d48401318a020e9a0ChemInform Abstract: Atomic Physicochemical Parameters for Three Dimensional Structure Directed Quantitative Structure\u2010Activity Relationships.
