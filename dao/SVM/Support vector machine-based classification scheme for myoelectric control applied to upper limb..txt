name: Support vector machine-based classification scheme for myoelectric control applied to upper limb.url: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM18632358public_in: 万方authors: Oskoei MA,Hu H,abstract: This paper proposes and evaluates the application of support vector machine (SVM) to classify upper limb motions using myoelectric signals. It explores the optimum configuration of SVM-based myoelectric control, by suggesting an advantageous data segmentation technique, feature set, model selection approach for SVM, and postprocessing methods. This work presents a method to adjust SVM parameters before classification, and examines overlapped segmentation and majority voting as two techniques to improve controller performance. A SVM, as the core of classification in myoelectric control, is compared with two commonly used classifiers: linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks. It demonstrates exceptional accuracy, robust performance, and low computational load. The entropy of the output of the classifier is also examined as an online index to evaluate the correctness of classification; this can be used by online training for long-term myoelectric control operations.citations_number: 334Citation: Electromyogram pattern recognition for control of powered upper-limb prostheses: state of the art and challenges for clinical use. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=115133bc64c0bf9112e2bad5bbc24690Driver Inattention Monitoring System for Intelligent Vehicles http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=49f4f48cd8e7e49dfd24a903506ffe41Feature reduction and selection for EMG signal classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=abdad4eb1bed27433999ab29e234c62eDecoding of individuated finger movements using surface electromyography. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d5debdd5851ab49eb531eb887379e0caControl of Hand Prostheses Using Peripheral Information http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0626c3e47bb20a1e7c083fe34a7d1ab5An Analysis of EMG Electrode Configuration for Targeted Muscle Reinnervation Based Neural Machine Interface http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9c83b2d23d7bfb77157e6bf779e386b4Surface EMG pattern recognition for real-time control of a wrist exoskeleton http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=228e82be3e798c55f676cdaee1204490Continuous locomotion-mode identification for prosthetic legs based on neuromuscular-mechanical fusion. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=632f8f98094dee33e994c764034db9e5Nontechnical Loss Detection for Metered Customers in Power Utility Using Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0506395831a85f6151805994fa5718c8Determining the optimal window length for pattern recognition-based myoelectric control: balancing the competing effects of classification error and contro... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=68d37b80a947e9fada0727b1a8055b80References: A new strategy for multifunction myoelectric control. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0fea5128ad82db70c25edec598e8c0b7Theory of Statistics http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bc65c9d0e188dabf2b78af1dba1a79dfA robust, real-time control scheme for multifunction myoelectric control http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=969b6da4860275875c6e02b591375e42A wavelet-based continuous classification scheme for multifunction myoelectric control. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f5315de8d4e043b72948b99855b3c57aA human-assisting manipulator teleoperated by EMG signals and arm motions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e2260723da91111001d25b510a7f8d7dA Gaussian mixture model based classification scheme for myoelectric control of powered upper limb prostheses http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a463417a74c534e2d5600d44d646e024Myoelectric control systems\u2014A survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6bad454cdc1fff565448812abe7ab1e9A heuristic fuzzy logic approach to EMG pattern recognition for multifunctional prosthesis control http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f9f3fe7204998c899dd6d339bf055b8eFuzzy EMG classification for prosthesis control http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6689b327876307b5eeb46003ee34c5f8Continuous myoelectric control for powered prostheses using hidden Markov models http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8ffb35d58cf2de7214c003e3c1161fedA tutorial on \u03bd\u2010support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7be0b2970f1fc3fe2241abf1027e383bEverything old is new again: a fresh look at historical approaches in machine learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d6a057bfdfaca91a8dcbcc7bd89bb355Cybernetic Biology.
