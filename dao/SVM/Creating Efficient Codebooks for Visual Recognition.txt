name: Creating Efficient Codebooks for Visual Recognitionurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/4193823_Creating_efficient_codebooks_for_visual_recognitionpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: GRAVIR-INRIA-CNRS,Montbonnot,Frederic Jurie,abstract: Visual codebook based quantization of robust appearance descriptors extracted from local image patches is an effective means of capturing image statistics for texture analysis and scene classification. Codebooks are usually constructed by using a method such as k-means to cluster the descriptor vectors of patches sampled either densely (?textons?) or sparsely (?bags of features? based on key-points or salience measures) from a set of training images. This works well for texture analysis in homogeneous images, but the images that arise in natural object recognition tasks have far less uniform statistics. We show that for dense sampling, k-means over-adapts to this, clustering centres almost exclusively around the densest few regions in descriptor space and thus failing to code other informative regions. This gives suboptimal codes that are no better than using randomly selected centres. We describe a scalable acceptance-radius based clusterer that generates better codebooks and study its performance on several image classification tasks. We also show that dense representations outperform equivalent keypoint based ones on these tasks and that SVM or Mutual Information based feature selection starting from a dense codebook further improves the performance.citations_number: 937Citation: Linear spatial pyramid matching using sparse coding for image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1b277be416a1290d54710a0dd4376505Locality-constrained Linear Coding for image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a7972b7d93fe3ef49f9e348f488ded39Locality-constrained Linear Coding for image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9d1fc0a6aedf5f4675d67b6f1ff4b55fLocal Features and Kernels for Classification of Texture and Object Categories: A Comprehensive Study http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=86a35f9917e82cabd8d8e30805e122ebThe 2005 PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ef2de41cfd916b79dfba868b8c80f6c9Evaluating Color Descriptors for Object and Scene Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f653988e5599eafea70d2e0c5b3fe930Local Invariant Feature Detectors:A Survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5a00db651dd9a13fc6e06ac033495e77In defense of Nearest-Neighbor based image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=efadc2516d5ed8d8fd4b338b622c75ebSampling Strategies for Bag-of-Features Image Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9ae5b216505357d153065a250d6da074Fisher Kernels on Visual Vocabularies for Image Categorization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=049c7ccda3f88cb5cf06468fbeb90a9cReferences: Representing and Recognizing the Visual Appearance of Materials using Three-dimensional Textons http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9634ede106fd13f4cd4775e0a4e209a4Learning to detect objects in images via a sparse, part-based representation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bf6dd22f660e76d95e4f97f9f63b190cA sparse texture representation using local affine regions. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f82a61c7c5d1bf10b075cf48f4d3fc69Unsupervised Learning of Models for Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fbc4143740706d83ef24f5a9729ef133Unsupervised Learning of Models for Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9addde0aa384dbe43463bbf6164d4656Sharing Features: Efficient Boosting Procedures for Multiclass Object Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=745b455dd1efbe9b93130fe437cec3d2Mean shift based clustering in high dimensions: a texture classification example http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8cdf9c687eaef61f50b94f036f76d536Face recognition: component-based versus global approaches http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0d11a70fb9717617316f134e22ce2169Selection of Scale-Invariant Parts for Object Class Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0d3401bc5d9017ff72e540059bbe4727Selected studies of the principle of relative frequency in language. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bcf5c09bf032b84edf1e086ccf426815Object recognition with informative features and linear classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9c45eff8761ab18cf30118e7ab20a953Object recognition with informative features and linear classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7473f8ee688cd845e0a30fd331bf1abfScale-invariant shape features for recognition of object categories http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5a59c01a72e7297cda43a1f491bcf28eWhat are textons?
