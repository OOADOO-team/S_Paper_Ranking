name: An Improved Training Algorithm for Support Vector Machinesurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2808303_An_Improved_Training_Algorithm_for_Support_Vector_Machinespublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Edgar Osuna,Robert Freund,Federico Girosi,abstract: We investigate the problem of training a support vector machine (SVM) on a very large database in the case in which the number of support vectors is also very large. Training a SVM is equivalent to solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming (QP) problem in a number of variables equal to the number of data points. This optimization problem is known to be challenging when the number of data points exceeds few thousands. In previous work done by us as well as by other researchers, the strategy used to solve the large scale QP problem takes advantage of the fact that the expected number of support vectors is small (&lt;3,000). Therefore, the existing algorithms cannot deal with more than a few thousand support vectors. In this paper we present a decomposition algorithm that is guaranteed to solve the QP problem and that does not make assumptions on the expected number of support vectors. In order to present the feasibility of our approach we consider a foreign exchange rate time series database with 110,000 data points that generates 100,000 support vectors.citations_number: 1803Citation: Statistical pattern recognition: a review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=079121efa11798514b67b66d00de4289\u5173\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9ff9531735d1c3074a95810c88dfd009Support vector machines for spam categorization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d35038b40f6d64c581932f54db35cec9Support vector machines for classification and regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8d91624686d4111b0a46388a0030b1a6Support vector machines for histogram-based image classification. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=166aeb4cc5fd24ee3e129acde3158edfCore Vector Machines: Fast SVM Training on Very Large Data Sets. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a870e6aad0696c5d8482f92b8a8787a9Kernel-based methods for hyperspectral image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=24589a6762785157c11e460107ebf1b6Advances in Large-Margin Classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=de719fc44d5db570ea98d5a819b13b54References: Support vector machines: Training and applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a9510c9b33d7c27d96fcdfed403be7caExtracting support data for a given task http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8c6d264ed3c1a6c55fe034331f12c99cLarge-Scale Linearly Constrained Optimization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7c04dd2ba6a78f00d73b71f2d92d5e29Proceedings of the First International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a1764460caa9d23d4b2c7e8721006f35Proceedings of the First International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a1764460caa9d23d4b2c7e8721006f35
