name: Support vector machines for spam categorizationurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM18252607public_in: 万方authors: Drucker, H., Donghui Wu, , Vapnik, V.N.,abstract: We study the use of support vector machines (SVM&#039;s) In classifying e-mail as spam or nonspam by comparing it to three other classification algorithms: Ripper, Rocchio, and boosting decision trees, These four algorithms were tested on two different data sets: one data set where the number of features were constrained to the 1000 best features and another data set where the dimensionality was over 7000, SVM&#039;s performed best when using binary features. For both data sets, boosting trees and SVM&#039;s had acceptable test performance in terms of accuracy and speed. However, SVM&#039;s had significantly less training time.citations_number: 1797Citation: Financial time series forecasting using support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fc97df9af80b0c44817924fc8da48160A novel method of protein secondary structure prediction with high segment overlap measure: support vector machine approach 1 \u2606 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a2ba11491ae669adc3c553402f134f8fBankruptcy prediction using support vector machine with optimal choice of kernel function parameters http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=46fe42ff5eec4b4d5fcee9dd76a1c404An application of support vector machines in bankruptcy prediction model. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c0695080324b5fe2fc514207e5aa8aa1Facial Expression Recognition in Image Sequences Using Geometric Deformation Features and Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=39d75cecacca97e726ac9a59f75772ddAdvanced support vector machines and kernel methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=732c14b474e665b319689947e39b4c40Data Mining with Computational Intelligence http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=967aeb2b7fb52e9ddbb75ed8426e5a27Application of LS-SVM to non-linear phenomena in NIR spectroscopy: development of a robust and portable sensor for acidity prediction in grapes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bc29f09627a871a21ac1c21abca58e83A SURVEY ON PATTERN RECOGNITION APPLICATIONS OF SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0de3cc6e23ebf6e7e34a2cd4d89b3d72A Memory-Based Approach to Anti-Spam Filtering for Mailing Lists http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4634d6f86b9d0745c6efebcdf39b0b7eReferences: A Probabilistic Analysis of the Rocchio Algorithm with TFIDF for Text Categorization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=79a72968823ec24b909c90fb6f40733fA Probabilistic Analysis of the Rocchio Algorithm with TFIDF for Text Categorization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a006bd7236b04964b13e0e8687cb3c85An improved training algorithm for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=139c8d7a401089d7e94702e27cad2875Context-sensitive learning methods for text categorization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=817cd373fd50e572ca08087376c5555aTraining algorithms for linear text classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a23975690912e24cf34a46a89f0a0e5eGame theory, on-line prediction and boosting http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=75ef140e9accf9a5ab45d336d619045fBoosting and Rocchio applied to text filtering http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c1adc00f4e7c6dca67a91c0e3303553aBoosting and Rocchio applied to text filtering http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=348df9685bcb6ede5182486928550e31Context-sensitive learning methods for text categorization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2913b81285caf8c9adc07a7a491767cb
