name: Probability Estimates for Multi-Class Classification by Pairwise Couplingurl: http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2248006public_in: AMSauthors: Ting-fan Wu,Chih-jen Lin,Ruby C. Weng,abstract: Pairwise coupling is a popular multi-class classification method that combines all comparisons for each pair of classes. This paper presents two approaches for obtaining class probabilities. Both methods can be reduced to linear systems and are easy to implement. We show conceptually and experimentally that the proposed approaches are more stable than the two existing popular methods: voting and the method by Hastie and Tibshirani (1998).citations_number: 1717Citation: LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b1552ffd60e8a942090f6dfadd26687Probability Estimates for Multi-class Classification by Pairwise Coupling http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=31ae585176690c114d87de06d8e26528Combining SVMs with Various Feature Selection Strategies http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=26cd4b9d7bc2cf3ffd3b29b9f1cc9966Combining SVMs with Various Feature Selection Strategies http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e44829df3b3ef501e17aadf45a67cb22Learning Actionlet Ensemble for 3D Human Action Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5b00e5ed96f494c334cc1d7b3ba6529bkernlab - An S4 Package for Kernel Methods in R http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=01e3e3304dbbe597edf8211f19182270Fast and robust text detection in images and video frames http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=964c1dd5f57102c64365fc4b5dd93fc1Which Is the Best Multiclass SVM Method?
