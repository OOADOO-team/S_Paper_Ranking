Increasingly, privacy and security concerns restrict this access, thus derailing data mining projects. What we need is distributed knowledge discovery that is sensitive to this problem. The key is to obtain valid results, while providing guarantees on the non-disclosure of data. Support vector machine classification is one of the most widely used classification methodologies in data mining and machine learning. It is based on solid theoretical foundations and has wide practical application. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving solution for support vector machine (SVM) classification, PP-SVM for short. Our solution constructs the global SVM classification model from the data distributed at multiple parties, without disclosing the data of each party to others. We assume that data is horizontally partitioned -- each party collects the same features of information for different data objects. We quantify the security and efficiency of the proposed method, and highlight future challenges.citations_number: 193Citation: A General Survey of Privacy-Preserving Data Mining Models and Algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=76891a8641c8a8a5c925daaa1f417f10A General Survey of Privacy-Preserving Data Mining Models and Algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=891af53002cc7c07fc108ded2c47f092On the Design and Analysis of the Privacy-Preserving SVM Classifier http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c2d35fe7f1fe7f9e576833152fdc173aPrivacy-preserving SVM classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ea00c1a7e9601e13c2351c832ddb66f5Privacy-Preserving SVM classification on vertically partitioned data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=88cd0034df27ff8863442bc66f93cf09Privacy-Preserving Backpropagation Neural Network Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=200f2e2de112b343eb2ea4f6833ccbf9Cryptographically private support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bff471eb558c89690c110d51ccb35d6aA Survey on Privacy Preserving Data Mining http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=971fc707c37effcdf0aa0f4d2391dc26Location Privacy Preservation in Collaborative Spectrum Sensing http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c1e34ec073c5ec6ecb4e7619216868c7Valid Statistical Analysis for Logistic Regression with Multiple Sources http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=579c99db4572f7adecafd33d88234684References: On the design and quantification of privacy preserving data mining algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=936c5fdc1ce2844c160accc6bf865da3Privacy-Preserving Distributed Mining of Association Rules on Horizontally Partitioned Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e1cea901d2b8670a938c52bbfc0c0875Multicategory proximal support vector machine classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1d15c90b43eac9e303d102de41ba3642Privacy Preserving Association Rule Mining in Vertically Partitioned Databases http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ff2a36755b8eee1fd1331213bf7c20faCloseGraph:mining closed frequent graph patterns http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=79238b9fc814e5c0de196466b2e9778aPrivacy-preserving k-means clustering over vertically partitioned data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=35329bcaf428b68406aa85ce193024b8CloseGraph: mining closed frequent graph patterns http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=23368f1ffceceb644d9832bfca33a713On the Privacy Preserving Properties of Random Data Perturbation Techniques. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=51045477524a30ec8f6b1a69a1110da0On the privacy preserving properties of random data perturbation techniques http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1fee5e4a2a9b6ab8db373b0209a0341aMaintaining Data Privacy in Association Rule Mining http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=81c57e039b956daebce63e788fd99c0aStandards for privacy of individually identifiable health information; proposed rule. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7b4f366a7affe7fce83422e93c27795bBuilding decision tree classifier on private data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e2e286f50bd396797cdcc92a0b822c1fStandards for privacy of individually identifiable health information.
