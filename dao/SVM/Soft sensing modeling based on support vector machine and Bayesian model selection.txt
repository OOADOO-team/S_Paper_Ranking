name: Soft sensing modeling based on support vector machine and Bayesian model selectionurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098135403003107public_in: Elsevierauthors: Weiwu Yan, Huihe Shao, Xiaofan Wang,abstract: Soft sensors have been widely used in industrial process control  to improve the quality of product and assure safety in production. The core of a soft sensor is to construct a soft sensing model. This paper introduces support vector machine (SVM), a new powerful machine learning  method based on statistical learning theory (SLT), into soft sensor  modeling and proposes a new soft sensing modeling method based on SVM. A  model selection method within the Bayesian evidence framework is  proposed to select an optimal model for a soft sensor based on SVM. In  case study, soft sensors based on SVM are applied to the estimation of  the freezing point of light diesel oil in distillation column. The  estimated outputs of SVM soft sensors with the optimal model match the  real values of the freezing point of light diesel oil and follow the  varying trend of the freezing point of light diesel oil very well.  Experiment results show that SVM provides a new and effective method for  soft sensing modeling and has promising application in industrial  process applicationscitations_number: 324Citation: Data-driven Soft Sensors in the process industry http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f7e84f409ccd76a129212f2726653d3fReview of adaptation mechanisms for data-driven soft sensors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0e06ea607936e2cdbeda3c6f202b4e08Development of a low cost fuel cell inverter system with DSP control http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=082e672ad325a21d961550d1c6db4aaaThe state of the art in chemical process control in Japan: Good practice and questionnaire survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dd8b642ea7d1a7ce536716a310bbd66a\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ff908bd1b6d1398179b1d77d1082f29bA Bayesian inference based two-stage support vector regression framework for soft sensor development in batch bioprocesses http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a0aa69ff432a727b7fa4594bd013ffddDevelopment of a new soft sensor method using independent component analysis and partial least squares http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8a425f65f921c293f659b6e326f7d324A comparative study of just-in-time-learning based methods for online soft sensor modeling http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b18a3fa87bc9792bd20a472c40899f46Design of inferential sensors in the process industry: A review of Bayesian methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5e956423c70099c8d510301185bd95c6Selective recursive kernel learning for online identification of nonlinear systems with NARX form http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=26c501f9965e398fd0b8fca1c390934eReferences: Bayesian Interpolation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8ab1fc1a09de9e29e8769e8b13e95bccProbable networks and plausible predictions \u2014 a review of practical Bayesian methods for supervised neural networks http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=683b99679ef32519cc495a98484580d0Bayesian Interpolation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4287abb168c69b82bc862ef3f649ca33Financial time series prediction using least squares support vector machines within the evidence framework. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ece847161a8280c50cfdb8077251339ePractical identification of NARMAX models using radial basis functions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=85c573565e45d17daa17d47bfc8ccf22Soft sensors development for on-line bioreactor state estimation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e8a9d9b2fc28370872c486c557a31f7bThe evidence framework applied to support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=430ea95972735dfc84b38901e36fecaeEstimation of distillation compositions from multiple temperature measurements using partial-least-squares regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a42942abcf95486e6bdbe298ce7acb0fNonlinear modelling and support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=22a4ed2ecbb8b4e406d0026ff3b81a07Development of inferential process models using PLS http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7e419efce4dead709416c5f9789a626aA nonlinear soft sensor based on multivariate smoothing procedure for quality estimation in distillation columns http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=20a3496cb3ef073989439387cabc0236Composition estimator in a pilot-plant distillation column using multiple temperatures http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5b92b7d32c304de4bf6637351cbd0830Inferential control of processes: Part I.
