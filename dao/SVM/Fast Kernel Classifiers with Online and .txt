name: Fast Kernel Classifiers with Online and Active Learningurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320193_Fast_Kernel_Classifiers_with_Online_and_Active_Learningpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Antoine Bordes,Ertekin Seyda,Jason Weston,abstract: Summary: Very high dimensional learning systems become theoretically possible when training examples are abundant. The computing cost then becomes the limiting factor. Any efficient learning algorithm should at least take a brief look at each example. But should all examples be given equal attention? This contribution proposes an empirical answer. We first present an online SVM algorithm based on this premise. LASVM yields competitive misclassification rates after a single pass over the training examples, outspeeding state-of-the-art SVM solvers. Then we show how active example selection can yield faster training, higher accuracies, and simpler models, using only a fraction of the training example labels.citations_number: 539Citation: Learning from Imbalanced Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=53206051b7c6b12d6ec7ad914bea41edPrediction, Learning, and Games http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=76fe5331a4501540ad65a2d864f76729Extreme learning machine for regression and multiclass classification. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6edb04901d6ffc75c8c36aae6e3bb14dPegasos: Primal Estimated sub-GrAdient SOlver for SVM http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d19c179365153d7743cf5aab07472191Fast maximum margin matrix factorization for collaborative prediction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c7356b4737be348cd2e9151582c05eb4Training a Support Vector Machine in the Primal http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=904694598f6f1c294f96163f072897e7What is a support vector machine? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5e308f5e06b57fe0f6232418bb2d1519Large Scale Transductive SVMs http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=381a01acc3e77e8e846610bfe4a203f0A user's guide to support vector machines. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=24467726abbecd2c74405fdf1b20465dThe Kernel Least-Mean-Square Algorithm http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b8a185308ebdcd22a9545a1561ecc4b4References: Bayesian Interpolation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=606e2896a29638dda5fccf27c589f38fBayesian Interpolation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8ab1fc1a09de9e29e8769e8b13e95bccInformation-Based Objective Functions for Active Data Selection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=37bedee542c6acb6651678058d9eb9beTheory of optimal experiments http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=71190e249a235aaa26c35b86de74f850The Evidence Framework applied to Classification Networks http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=eaaf5a0db4d35ce4ab6ae28a1dbb7c29An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-based Learning Methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0c522e3cf4b0b69b8c1a26197f04a20cIncremental and Decremental Support Vector Machine Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3eef2e10526d9ac6bcdcb1512ca34ebbSVMTorch: support vector machines for large-scale regression problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d73d941ff03709380fd407d1b644d45SVMTorch: support vector machines for large-scale regression problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=60a9069d18c3f025967de4fee051828e
