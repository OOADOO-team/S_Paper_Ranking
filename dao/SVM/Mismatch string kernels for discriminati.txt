S., Eskin, E., Cohen, A.,abstract: Motivation: Classification of proteins sequences into functional and structural families based on sequence homology is a central problem in computational biology. Discriminative supervised machine learning approaches provide good performance, but simplicity and computational efficiency of training and prediction are also important concerns. Results: We introduce a class of string kernels, called mismatch kernels, for use with support vector machines (SVMs) in a discriminative approach to the problem of protein classification and remote homology detection. These kernels measure sequence similarity based on shared occurrences of fixed-length patterns in the data, allowing for mutations between patterns. Thus, the kernels provide a biologically well-motivated way to compare protein sequences without relying on family-based generative models such as hidden Markov models. We compute the kernels efficiently using a mismatch tree data structure, allowing us to calculate the contributions of all patterns occurring in the data in one pass while traversing the tree. When used with an SVM, the kernels enable fast prediction on test sequences. We report experiments on two benchmark SCOP datasets, where we show that the mismatch kernel used with an SVM classifier performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods for homology detection, particularly when very few training examples are available. Examination of the highest-weighted patterns learned by the SVM classifier recovers biologically important motifs in protein families and superfamilies.citations_number: 619Citation: Classification of real and pseudo microRNA precursors using local structure-sequence features and support vector machine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=560bc28f69b5cfe56ad26c8ea9890d09A computational study of off-target effects of RNA interference http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d8a8877beb4a072814365bc1f868abaaSupport Vector Machine Applications in Computational Biology http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c3337a61ebf14aa6d33017e767f5754bProfile-based string kernels for remote homology detection and motif extraction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=84588fc77eb4760f71d026e961656024Applications of Support Vector Machines in Chemistry http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=70dc46018ff6efb0b63b548ee38b5b8aRay Meta: scalable de novo metagenome assembly and profiling. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c0c521afa6463d53bbcca1b06a91eb3cOn prediction using variable order markov models http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9385c1e25e2944f9ef44021b6f6df178Fast String Kernels using Inexact Matching for Protein Sequences http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5b1192e86bf2daac0b9b70e04b7d2184Fast String Kernels using Inexact Matching for Protein Sequences http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5eaed429c42b8dd8124fb4e8a037f948Accurate identification of alternatively spliced exons using support vector machine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3d2d7ec4413252dcccfebbbce0345ae9References: On Comparing Classifiers: Pitfalls to Avoid and a Recommended Approach http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=681ceeb69d21609bad04f27d9c41a880Algorithms on Strings, Trees, and Sequences http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c26e696c10333acb98a1a2b36da510f1Hidden Markov models of biological primary sequence information. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=de25349552289c429d3c55a841707215Combining pairwise sequence similarity and support vector machines for detecting remote protein evolutionary and structural relationships. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2015a4ed1f0cf5dd676fc916bf428ea8Combining pairwise sequence similarity and support vector machines for remote protein homology detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=19e7d9debeb2e2fd8b494bd2a1bfb030Fast Kernels for String and Tree Matching http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8f0e7b664b40f9de6039f651ca796053Fast Kernels for String and Tree Matching http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3594199ff31c975d34e7fced12245f02A New Discriminative Kernel from Probabilistic Models http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1ffa25fad502ec2347b73cd76422e81bThe PRINTS protein fingerprint database in its fifth year. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fa313318bbd5228635d92c6a9de09726What is the value added by human intervention in protein structure prediction?
