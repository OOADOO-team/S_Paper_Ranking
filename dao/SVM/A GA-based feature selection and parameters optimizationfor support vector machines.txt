name: A GA-based feature selection and parameters optimizationfor support vector machinesurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417405002083public_in: Elsevierauthors: Cheng-Lung Huang, Chieh-Jen Wang,abstract: Support Vector Machines, one of the new techniques for pattern classification, have been widely used in many application areas. The kernel parameters setting for SVM in a training process impacts on the classification accuracy. Feature selection is another factor that impacts classification accuracy. The objective of this research is to simultaneously optimize the parameters and feature subset without degrading the SVM classification accuracy. We present a genetic algorithm approach for feature selection and parameters optimization to solve this kind of problem.We tried several real-world datasets using the proposed GA-based approach and the Grid algorithm, a traditional method of performing parameters searching. Compared with the Grid algorithm, our proposed GA-based approach significantly improves the classification accuracy and has fewer input features for support vector machines.citations_number:
