name: Top 10 algorithms in data miningurl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10115-007-0114-2public_in: Springerauthors: Xindong Wu, Vipin Kumar, J. Ross Quinlan,abstract: This paper presents the top 10 data mining algorithms identified by the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) in December 2006: C4.5, k-Means, SVM, Apriori, EM, PageRank, AdaBoost, ANN, Naive Bayes, and CART. These top 10 algorithms are among the most influential data mining algorithms in the research community. With each algorithm, we provide a description of the algorithm, discuss the impact of the algorithm, and review current and further research on the algorithm. These 10 algorithms cover classification,clustering, statistical learning, association analysis, and link mining, which are all among the most important topics in data mining research and development.citations_number: 2455Citation: A Survey on Transfer Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ec1ecbd0509de6c42d304a6902afc203Big Data: A Survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5887b3639dab50d9444d34a812083e80A Review on Ensembles for the Class Imbalance Problem: Bagging-, Boosting-, and Hybrid-Based Approaches http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fd21027c84a6f27f67cacab40fb66a88Semi-supervised learning by disagreement http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=106e7fb3b86438a6a50c904632448cbaSemi-supervised learning by disagreement http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3e922960dc9251282e17ee3d908f24b3A survey of multiple classifier systems as hybrid systems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ba077f84ffdb7e52ebff7f54f9985368Accumulated Cost Based Test-Cost-Sensitive Attribute Reduction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=441f85344b61eefa978f052b3f00cfee\u5927\u6570\u636e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6d741f8c62fac2c2a81f08d3c72627aaData Mining for Internet of Things: A Survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cf8f0d3a8e3ea78f074622347bd685c9Evaluation of contextual information retrieval effectiveness: overview of issues and research http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=be7dda20baffab9a1c4e8e1eae845130References: The strength of weak learnability http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1650cd6616f0749a4765524f9e075a43An algorithm for finding best matches in logarithmic expected time http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f518472811d7a49e1db3fb8b81a1f696Clustering with Bregman Divergences http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9ec4ec4897227e7a628f999c5d54111eAsymptotic Properties of Nearest Neighbor Rules Using Edited Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c43c0dd5f349728a7fcd2130945a47ceCore Vector Machines: Fast SVM Training on Very Large Data Sets. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a870e6aad0696c5d8482f92b8a8787a9A Review and Empirical Evaluation of Feature Weighting Methods for a Class of Lazy Learning Algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e79a6d80c17032848949b598543c8f5aKernel k-means:spectral clustering and normalized cuts http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9281c3d2137ac4a777143f8696f8c680Web data mining: exploring hyperlinks, contents, and usage data. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=826ccf55760f0111d415208e13adc1bbExperiments in induction. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f9de911f6d126c3480dd3c9aed0f916b
