name: An SVM learning approach to robotic graspingurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221070976_An_SVM_Learning_Approach_to_Robotic_Graspingpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Pelossof, R,Miller, A,Allen, P,abstract: Finding appropriate stable grasps for a hand (either robotic or human) on an arbitrary object has proved to be a challenging and difficult problem. The space of grasping parameters coupled with the degrees-of-freedom and geometry of the object to be grasped creates a high-dimensional, non-smooth manifold. Traditional search methods applied to this manifold are typically not powerful enough to find appropriate stable grasping solutions, let alone optimal grasps. We address this issue in this paper, which attempts to find optimal grasps of objects using a grasping simulator. Our unique approach to the problem involves a combination of numerical methods to recover parts of the grasp quality surface with any robotic hand, and contemporary machine learning methods to interpolate that surface, in order to find the optimal grasp.citations_number: 178Citation: Graspit!
