name: Extreme Learning Machine for Regression and Multiclass Classificationurl: http://www.europepmc.org/abstract/MED/21984515public_in: Europe PMCauthors: Guang-Bin Huang, Hongming Zhou, Xiaojian Ding,abstract: Due to the simplicity of their implementations, least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and proximal support vector machine (PSVM) have been widely used in binary classification applications. The conventional LS-SVM and PSVM cannot be used in regression and multiclass classification applications directly, although variants of LS-SVM and PSVM have been proposed to handle such cases. This paper shows that both LS-SVM and PSVM can be simplified further and a unified learning framework of LS-SVM, PSVM, and other regularization algorithms referred to extreme learning machine (ELM) can be built. ELM works for the ldquogeneralizedrdquo single-hidden-layer feedforward networks (SLFNs), but the hidden layer (or called feature mapping) in ELM need not be tuned. Such SLFNs include but are not limited to SVM, polynomial network, and the conventional feedforward neural networks. This paper shows the following: 1) ELM provides a unified learning platform with a widespread type of feature mappings and can be applied in regression and multiclass classification applications directly; 2) from the optimization method point of view, ELM has milder optimization constraints compared to LS-SVM and PSVM; 3) in theory, compared to ELM, LS-SVM and PSVM achieve suboptimal solutions and require higher computational complexity; and 4) in theory, ELM can approximate any target continuous function and classify any disjoint regions. As verified by the simulation results, ELM tends to have better scalability and achieve similar (for regression and binary class cases) or much better (for multiclass cases) generalization performance at much faster learning speed (up to thousands times) than traditional SVM and LS-SVM.citations_number: 1760Citation: Do we need hundreds of classifiers to solve real world classification problems? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=491eb32b0997a8dde16c12fe69bf3eacAn Insight into Extreme Learning Machines: Random Neurons, Random Features and Kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9af5045ee2bc1400669cea54d987ea82Trends in extreme learning machines: A review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cf0fdc3ffb3933252d93c0c0954a73eaBenchmarking state-of-the-art classification algorithms for credit scoring: An update of research http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=994e94d082a24a21734a89f43ff4caf4Sentic patterns: Dependency-based rules for concept-level sentiment analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=37af095f8f79c3c3c4f33720006eaa27Robust twin support vector machine for pattern classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f5904bed50ad941ee24b8e38d186d6c3Prediction of protein-protein interactions from amino acid sequences;with ensemble extreme learning machines and principal component analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1e3cf8ac3dbd4d387ebae460f2fe9797Prediction of protein-protein interactions from amino acid sequences using extreme learning machine combined with auto covariance descriptor http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e6c16d7ac56a56f18a4f4c8dadd6d0e5What are Extreme Learning Machines?
