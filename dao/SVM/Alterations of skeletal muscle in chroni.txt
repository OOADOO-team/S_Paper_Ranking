The present study was designed to define the prevalence and characteristics of skeletal muscle alterations in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and their relation to exercise capacity. Methods and Results.  The ultrastructure of skeletal muscle was analyzed by ultrastructural morphometry in 57 patients with CHF and 18 healthy controls.  The volume density of mitochondria (Vvm) and the surface density (Svmc) of mitochondrial cristae were evaluated as a structural correlate of oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle.  Vvm and Svmc were reduced by approximately 20% in patients with severe CHF irrespective of age and etiology.  The cytochrome oxidase activity in mitochondria as determined by cytochemistry and subsequent morphometry in a subset of patients (n = 10) was significantly decreased in heart failure (p &lt; 0.01).  The capillary length density of skeletal muscle was reduced in CHF (n = 12, p &lt; 0.05), and the fiber type distribution was shifted to type II fibers (n = 15, p &lt; 0.05).  Vvm and Svmc were significantly related to peak exercise VO2 (r = 0.56, p &lt; 0.001, n = 60) and to VO2 at anaerobic threshold (r = 0.535, p &lt; 0.0001, n = 60).  In 16 patients with severe heart failure, Vvm was inversely related to the duration of heart failure (r = 0.545, p &lt; 0.03).  In 11 patients who underwent repeat biopsies after 4 months, a correlation was observed between the change in Vvm and the change in peak exercise VO2 (r = 0.89, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions.  These findings indicate that patients with CHF develop significant ultrastructural abnormalities of skeletal muscle reflecting a depressed oxidative capacity of working muscle.  It appears that these alterations of skeletal muscle contribute to the decreased exercise capacity of these patients but are, in principle, reversible by an effective treatment regimen.citations_number: 720Citation: Wasting as independent risk factor for mortality in chronic heart failure http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1f450ca875de09c8d597009579346d7aEffects of Exercise Training on Left Ventricular Function and Peripheral Resistance in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d825368aea2243ff0eaf9d38fc8e574Contribution of skeletal muscle atrophy to exercise intolerance and altered muscle metabolism in heart failure. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=db6e698ff881a87c4aee8ccea020483fChronic disability trends in elderly United States populations:\u20091982\u20131994 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=19b1947d9dcd37573c84bcedf65b035eExercise and heart failure: A statement from the American Heart Association Committee on exercise, rehabilitation, and prevention. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=55199e898901f9fd16f102eeb403de9dAlterations of skeletal muscle in chronic heart failure. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e976b6cea3617bd1272f0e6ec2babf82Physical training in patients with stable chronic heart failure: effects on cardiorespiratory fitness and ultrastructural abnormalities of leg muscles. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9c32c510b15d07f47677a6305a318fc3Exercise limitation in chronic heart failure: central role of the periphery. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c99b45f4580662cb3ff9cec0d95b383aExercise and Respiratory Training Improve Exercise Capacity and Quality of Life in Patients With Severe Chronic Pulmonary Hypertension http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=93469b9d876f62096392796b9b0c849fReferences: Adaptations of skeletal muscle to endurance exercise and their metabolic consequences. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=817d620d3a80c18d602c9693b61b8066Effect of training on blood lactate levels during submaximal exercise http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e1411a8c4dc128ffef8c59a38c2ea579Glucose tolerance in young and older athletes and sedentary men. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a2fadcee418483f5386454de5332f9adCardiovascular adaptations to physical training http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=30df9d9c56a631185a180cc7eab0dc22Lack of correlation between exercise capacity and indexes of resting left ventricular performance in heart failure http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e2b0fe46b4c0feb9965e9fef9b070a08Oxygen utilization and ventilation during exercise in patients with chronic cardiac failure. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7663ed081d581c41512fdeed29059e84Skeletal muscle metabolism during exercise under ischemic conditions in congestive heart failure.
