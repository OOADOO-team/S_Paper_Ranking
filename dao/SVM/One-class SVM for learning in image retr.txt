name: One-class SVM for learning in image retrievalurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/3920172_One-class_SVM_for_learning_in_image_retrievalpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Yunqiang Chen,Xiang Sean Zhou,Thomas S. Huang,abstract: Relevance feedback schemes using linear/quadratic estimators have been applied in content-based image retrieval to improve retrieval performance significantly. One major difficulty in relevance feedback is to estimate the support of target images in high dimensional feature space with a relatively small number of training samples. We develop a novel scheme based on one-class SVM, which fits a tight hyper-sphere in the nonlinearly transformed feature space to include most of the target images based on positive examples. The use of a kernel provides us an elegant way to deal with nonlinearity in the distribution of the target images, while the regularization term in SVM provides good generalization ability. To validate the efficacy of the proposed approach, we test it on both synthesized data and real-world images. Promising results are achieved in both casescitations_number: 616Citation: Image retrieval:Ideas, influences, and trends of the new age http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bec5ce0ed321005f018803d8a667b7b5Content-based multimedia information retrieval:State of the art and challenges http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2c163b7cf008ce6d71646b7c79ad9049Relevance feedback in image retrieval: A comprehensive review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d6f76e8c9e005a7327dbfdf0638ad2a4Asymmetric bagging and random subspace for support vector machines-based relevance feedback in image retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3cf20690b1a5343c8c6c5d51269d9d63Ensemble of exemplar-SVMs for object detection and beyond http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=22a0af26037025bc38a5d1e18d28fa21Unsupervised Salience Learning for Person Re-identification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=eaecae3fa9c4ff533e628a71fbe8d0d2Manifold-ranking based image retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=68095440818ab73ce84b741a23455ad4Small sample learning during multimedia retrieval using BiasMap http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=60ea0bb08b489426ff4aafcccfabd7f4Small Sample Learning during Multimedia Retrieval using BiasMap http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9c4c4f2767892d0520c0fb86f303e692Extreme re-balancing for SVMs: a case study http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c8b26a8f13d51d3e391efd72a988c6ddReferences: The query by image content (QBIC) system http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6886d3c41d1adb6f15eb2a05330ed91fRelevance feedback: a power tool for interactive content-based image retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8ba2aafdf624f9c0ee46e93825f7cc24Boosting image retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7d04ec64a51f94def0255313be80d57aMindReader: Querying databases through multiple examples http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=99f13c0a550832c0bd8ff5f2202fcc01Optimizing Learning in Image Retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2c0ad3b92d7dd9a8f3efb1e4dafe4eb9PicSOM \u2013 content-based image retrieval with self-organizing maps http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b564058956f3102c2569d5f02fcfcb1dDiscriminant-EM algorithm with application to image retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=376fc6998deca1ad578ddc924bef3560Probabilistic Feature Relevance Learning for Content-Based Image Retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=563369acddc192f6da37305af9a56ce1Probabilistic feature relevance learining for content-based image retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d4b1f3211a79291b781f012a26f23adaAn Optimized Interaction Strategy for Bayesian Relevance Feedback http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=241a6fd684b2e2cddd6229bc49d58146Edge-based structural features for content-based image retrieval \u2606 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cb220981ba3cdf4a558500b04fa6e5b1Bayesian Relevance Feedback for Content-Based Image Retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=baaf3a1196e98fe2b30135efcd24226aEfficient Query Refinement for Image Retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=577c23c8179c9aa02a8c58f5cc20d372Self-Organizing Maps for Content-Based Image Database Retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b31d5f79a90f7dcb067582c38fbb84e2Self-Organizing Maps for Content-Based Image Retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9f54cc076e592767e42091b8c32d4815Update relevant image weights for content-based image retrieval using support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5eb4f53fce23275284ad2d97a608a982The query by image content (QBIC) system http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a1176b16af260d75e7566114a137008eOptimizing learning in image retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0877439de79425a1a9f4c6aef6edbec3
