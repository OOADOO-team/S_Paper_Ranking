name: Machine learning classifiers and fMRI: a tutorial overviewurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail?id=PeriodicalPaper_JJ0217541578public_in: 万方authors: Francisco Pereira,Tom Mitchell,Matthew Botvinick,abstract: Interpreting brain image experiments requires analysis of complex, multivariate data. In recent years, one analysis approach that has grown in popularity is the use of machine learning algorithms to train classifiers to decode stimuli, mental states, behaviours and other variables of interest from fMRI data and thereby show the data contain information about them. In this tutorial overview we review some of the key choices faced in using this approach as well as how to derive statistically significant results, illustrating each point from a case study. Furthermore, we show how, in addition to answering the question of ‘is there information about a variable of interest’ (pattern discrimination), classifiers can be used to tackle other classes of question, namely ‘where is the information’ (pattern localization) and ‘how is that information encoded’ (pattern characterization).citations_number: 870Citation: Prediction of individual brain maturity using fMRI. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0c28ba4a37ca6251eb899634a383e3a4Introduction to machine learning for brain imaging. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=71839baa1b3c8111181599f1566fc8a8Identifying major depression using whole-brain functional connectivity: a multivariate pattern analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2bda5572fb855e91c2a954977be13f8dThe Brain\u2013Computer Interface Cycle http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c94ad61a76395df716c5028d2c4f47e9Encoding and decoding in fMRI http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=504c485bed53ae5cb63f0c8df922b23cA survey of the burden of allergic rhinitis in the USA http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=05a0101b136b6ff4ceae72a6aeeca893Decoding an individual's sensitivity to pain from the multivariate analysis of EEG data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a4e68bf7c639161b37dd5e1d71f9c7f9Revealing representational content with pattern-information fMRI\u2014an introductory guide http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=61831f47f7d43bee0042bf6885fa0f2aResting state fMRI: A review of methods and clinical applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a9b6178b1f1acf3492ef0e6118651797Discriminative analysis of resting-state functional connectivity patterns of schizophrenia using low dimensional embedding of fMRI. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=03838202b31cf7b504536ea10d299bb3References: Beyond mind-reading: multi-voxel pattern analysis of fMRI data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4b20fc69c101fd43b902296a9caef7deInterval Estimation for a Binomial Proportion http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2b307034baaf9025d691324ad9d5170fComparing Support Vector Machines with Gaussian Kernels to Radial Basis Function Classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=aebd67933e2ab7a3926a004c60680351Neuroimaging: Decoding mental states from brain activity in humans http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8e66f9f828f5b07e9e4675d519244a4cDecoding the visual and subjective contents of the human brain. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=64b47ec62023a28de82c4fe3aab83ac6Predicting Human Brain Activity Associated with the Meanings of Nouns http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=990623c4c317e797bcf6e75f3bbd7bebImproved estimation of the covariance matrix of stock returns with an application to portfolio selection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a55de2ff60e53901d70d34a1efdbdf67Learning to Decode Cognitive States from Brain Images http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b4cef00bf64f16455801e44afa1fd120Permutation, Parametric, and Bootstrap Tests of Hypotheses (3rd ed.) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3aa37b83bd06201ef153007a27b408fc
