name: Training nu-support vector classifiers: theory and algorithms.url: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11516360public_in: NCBIauthors: Chang CC,Lin CJ,abstract: Abstract The nu-support vector machine (nu-SVM) for classification proposed by SchÃ¶lkopf, Smola, Williamson, and Bartlett (2000) has the advantage of using a parameter nu on controlling the number of support vectors. In this article, we investigate the relation between nu-SVM and C-SVM in detail. We show that in general they are two different problems with the same optimal solution set. Hence, we may expect that many numerical aspects of solving them are similar. However, compared to regular C-SVM, the formulation of nu-SVM is more complicated, so up to now there have been no effective methods for solving large-scale nu-SVM. We propose a decomposition method for nu-SVM that is competitive with existing methods for C-SVM. We also discuss the behavior of nu-SVM by some numerical experiments.citations_number: 679Citation: LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b1552ffd60e8a942090f6dfadd26687LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=309e25e4e7d5ca5cbe656208c220a1afAsymptotic behaviors of support vector machines with gaussian kernel http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=abca416fb71ce1fe858c348548891de5On the convergence of the decomposition method for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ebac281a793039df68c1635c8184b7a3Prediction of Protein Subcellular Localizations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fff371ce81eb7c1dbe0adb25b633c593Training nu-support vector regression: theory and algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cb674ef2c8eb11d0cc778d3c2c0f59a7Prediction of protein subcellular localization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=15dfbc30755ae4cdca727f5fb3646057Classifying Large Data Sets Using SVM with Hierarchical Clusters http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a930b63bbd945bc5126f59e39e4f281eReferences: Successive overrelaxation for support vector machines. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c986a2e5dbef193c7cfbc659ee17a867A fast iterative nearest point algorithm for support vector machine classifier design http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f53f633fc71e56e8bfff082426a6cf94The Kernel-Adatron Algorithm: A Fast and Simple Learning Procedure for Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fcef67189e1befbb9bdbe4df36b5b48bOn the convergence of the decomposition method for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ebac281a793039df68c1635c8184b7a3The analysis of decomposition methods for support vector machines. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c29f752e36f53d21204440b6d43ab298Shrinking the tube: a new support vector regression algorithm http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9f817663f688e23e79dc9520d367064fFormulations of Support Vector Machines: A Note from an Optimization Point of View http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dddfc631a877862d320885d551677074A geometric interpretation of \u03bd-SVM classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9f50e26bc8bea7913de291974a5b4b8fA Geometric Interpretation of \u03bd-SVM Classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=07fd123279e6fbc3a911487803542b2fOn the convergence of the decomposition method for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b226e8315e7f28577570adf2b02a6bef
