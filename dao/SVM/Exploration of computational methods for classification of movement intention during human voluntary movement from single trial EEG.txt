name: Exploration of computational methods for classification of movement intention during human voluntary movement from single trial EEGurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1388245707004312public_in: Elsevierauthors: Bai, O,Lin, P,Vorbach, S,abstract: To explore effective combinations of computational methods for the prediction of movement intention preceding the production of self-paced right and left hand movements from single trial scalp electroencephalogram (EEG). Twelve naïve subjects performed self-paced movements consisting of three key strokes with either hand. EEG was recorded from 128 channels. The exploration was performed offline on single trial EEG data. We proposed that a successful computational procedure for classification would consist of spatial filtering, temporal filtering, feature selection, and pattern classification. A systematic investigation was performed with combinations of spatial filtering using principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), common spatial patterns analysis (CSP), and surface Laplacian derivation (SLD); temporal filtering using power spectral density estimation (PSD) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT); pattern classification using linear Mahalanobis distance classifier (LMD), quadratic Mahalanobis distance classifier (QMD), Bayesian classifier (BSC), multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLP), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and support vector machine (SVM). A robust multivariate feature selection strategy using a genetic algorithm was employed. The combinations of spatial filtering using ICA and SLD, temporal filtering using PSD and DWT, and classification methods using LMD, QMD, BSC and SVM provided higher performance than those of other combinations. Utilizing one of the better combinations of ICA, PSD and SVM, the discrimination accuracy was as high as 75%. Further feature analysis showed that beta band EEG activity of the channels over right sensorimotor cortex was most appropriate for discrimination of right and left hand movement intention. Effective combinations of computational methods provide possible classification of human movement intention from single trial EEG. Such a method could be the basis for a potential brain–computer interface based on human natural movement, which might reduce the requirement of long-term training. Effective combinations of computational methods can classify human movement intention from single trial EEG with reasonable accuracy.citations_number: 136Citation: Brain-computer interfaces in neurological rehabilitation. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1363190165b66f632ba9f395912e68a2EMG and EOG artifacts in brain computer interface systems: A survey - Clinical Neurophysiology http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b3adbaeb959fc5b7da9217ac1058c53aBedside detection of awareness in the vegetative state: a cohort study http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=23d8cf44ddd28893c4afbce433ca8323Scalp electrical recording during paralysis: Quantitative evidence that EEG frequencies above 20Hz are contaminated by EMG http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=00a9163342407bb290658d70f4c38292Exploration of computational methods for classification of movement intention during human voluntary movement from single trial EEG http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=931ff025af2f2be82975c710ea3bdf00Determination of awareness in patients with severe brain injury using EEG power spectral analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=22b628e35a184c827454c4ce4e61df15Prediction of human voluntary movement before it occurs http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d66e8a5b627518d3df27d46c8b2e7261Classifying EEG signals preceding right hand, left hand, tongue, and right foot movements and motor imageries http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8c9cdd05cf698189778a27c156b04098Detection of self-paced reaching movement intention from EEGsignals http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b9ceb8966d63089760b3d0df16839148Applications of machine learning and high-dimensional visualization in cancer detection, diagnosis, and management. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1daa6b2f42135b6fdba65f5de292c289References: Advanced Methods in Neural Computing http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6dcccf258cd9f39147b97475fc910fc2An EEG-based brain-computer interface for cursor control. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=219c3419d0c497bc85ad2d1145697363NETLAB: algorithms for pattern recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0a5a3e7bdae56e8740d468d536bf2437Dimensionality reduction using genetic algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6c0c07ce8e5c0f78231d5327f1b562ceMu rhythm (de)synchronization and EEG single-trial classification of different motor imagery tasks. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9c76c6726883045cdb6ec3a06fdbb935EEG coherency.
