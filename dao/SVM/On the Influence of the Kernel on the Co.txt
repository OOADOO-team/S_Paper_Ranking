name: On the Influence of the Kernel on the Consistency of Support Vector Machinesurl: http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1883281public_in: AMSauthors: Ingo Steinwart,abstract: In this article we study the generalization abilities of several classifiers of support vector machine (SVM) type using a certain class of kernels that we call universal. It is shown that the soft margin algorithms with universal kernels are consistent for a large class of classification problems including some kind of noisy tasks provided that the regularization parameter is chosen well. In particular we derive a simple sufficient condition for this parameter in the case of Gaussian RBF kernels. On the one hand our considerations are based on an investigation of an approximation propertyï¿½the so-called universalityï¿½of the used kernels that ensures that all continuous functions can be approximated by certain kernel expressions. This approximation property also gives a new insight into the role of kernels in these and other algorithms. On the other hand the results are achieved by a precise study of the underlying optimization problems of the classifiers. Furthermore, we show consistency for the maximal margin classifier as well as for the soft margin SVM&#039;s in the presence of large margins. In this case it turns out that also constant regularization parameters ensure consistency for the soft margin SVM&#039;s. Finally we prove that even for simple, noise free classification problems SVM&#039;s with polynomial kernels can behave arbitrarily badly.citations_number: 560Citation: Learning with Kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a9e264443461d780494802f48c7bc1b0Correcting sample selection bias by unlabeled data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b79c07ebf538af30eca8cb36f3f2c9c3Correcting Sample Selection Bias by Unlabeled Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=81f5154dc606784644ebdf4105016c70Correcting Sample Selection Bias by Unlabeled Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=80d6ee56c7aeff0159dba9c006284169Domain Adaptation via Transfer Component Analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cca1accda380dd801b4b9836f0208cc6Consistency of the Group Lasso and Multiple Kernel Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d6875a87bec02db79ad46e0a95c34b39Kernel Methods in Machine Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4ba954f8b0d51f1363e9fcf5709312e5A Kernel Method for the Two-Sample-Problem http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=eb723598f141fc35164cb748a9b95a46A Kernel Method for the Two-Sample-Problem http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f4d9d7948d90efe4b03163786748a25aMeasuring Statistical Dependence with Hilbert-Schmidt Norms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=97495d24f34a6e73fec75c5a6fc3dda3References: Real analysis and probability http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8c8cd5aec6d6d2588f5e5daf8672369fAn Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-based Learning Methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0c522e3cf4b0b69b8c1a26197f04a20cA Generalized Representer Theorem http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=30d83aee59bfe3c33743762ee1c25322A Generalized Representer Theorem http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=57e1c297ec43fdb1da87c8b87dc7a959Structural risk minimization over data-dependent hierarchies http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e0b96e99cdb22163f13012a665d74fe8Central Limit Theorems for Empirical Measures http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fedeca2a26888b9985aeef82a8cd9579Generalization performance of support vector machines and other pattern classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=483c1dbe910babed6effd86c2b8828dbOn optimal nonlinear associative recall. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1af5a7ff80c674ffa2c14f6650b97d2cAnalysis Now http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6fce15c6156ea89214843fac9b1cef14The orientation of flies towards visual patterns: On the search for the underlying functional interactions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=605f2f0cf7b78f2d3bc54405f9901f8bAnalysis Now http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c770a923674125f1180a03062d81ca4bAnalysis now http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=06ec4473ed5271c427fb7f9af2a84c46Summen-Produkt-und Integral-Tafeln http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9700bc386bb6d5b943ab711440cc26d5A Leave-one-out Cross Validation Bound for Kernel Methods with Applications in Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5da47949d9c3f4d231968d2f29a19b99A Sequential Approximation Bound for Some Sample-Dependent Convex Optimization Problems with Applications in Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f028f555c9dc294683c8e1592b10b596A Sequential Approximation Bound for Some Sample-Dependent Convex Optimization Problems with Applications in Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ed9e4a03784e548867959e9d5c1018a8A Sequential Approximation Bound for Some Sample-Dependent Convex Optimization Problems with Applications in Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9db46c6c33d7189d5611019cf20ed7bb
