name: Classification using intersection kernel support vector machines is efficienturl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221363163_Classification_using_intersection_kernel_support_vector_machines_is_efficientpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Subhransu Maji,Alexander C. Berg,Jitendra Malik,abstract: Straightforward classification using kernelized SVMs requires evaluating the kernel for a test vector and each of the support vectors. For a class of kernels we show that one can do this much more efficiently. In particular we show that one can build histogram intersection kernel SVMs (IKSVMs) with runtime complexity of the classifier logarithmic in the number of support vectors as opposed to linear for the standard approach. We further show that by precomputing auxiliary tables we can construct an approximate classifier with constant runtime and space requirements, independent of the number of support vectors, with negligible loss in classification accuracy on various tasks. This approximation also applies to 1 — χ2 and other kernels of similar form. We also introduce novel features based on a multi-level histograms of oriented edge energy and present experiments on various detection datasets. On the INRIA pedestrian dataset an approximate IKSVM classifier based on these features has the current best performance, with a miss rate 13% lower at 10−6 False Positive Per Window than the linear SVM detector of Dalal &amp; Triggs. On the Daimler Chrysler pedestrian dataset IKSVM gives comparable accuracy to the best results (based on quadratic SVM), while being 15× faster. In these experiments our approximate IKSVM is up to 2000× faster than a standard implementation and requires 200× less memory. Finally we show that a 50× speedup is possible using approximate IKSVM based on spatial pyramid features on the Caltech 101 dataset with negligible loss of accuracy.citations_number: 954Citation: Linear spatial pyramid matching using sparse coding for image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1b277be416a1290d54710a0dd4376505Selective Search for Object Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b689fcf3ed998dfbb4213687367b6175Pedestrian Detection: An Evaluation of the State of the Art http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=484460277f448fe1390d74c58c5af83eEfficient additive kernels via explicit feature maps. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3f37e97734b9526cbdb34d5496f310d5Efficient additive kernels via explicit feature maps http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e22696ba35f2d233657cc6ced56a1d5bSurvey of pedestrian detection for advanced driver assistance systems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ed57919592d324ef1239185a0ced9c79Measuring the Objectness of Image Windows http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6ff98c055a45f329fb75020e042decb6Image Classification with the Fisher Vector: Theory and Practice http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=86d965669f1251e22525771855dfc04aHuman detection using partial least squares analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=17c1e172d77c2b341eb6cbc0e1d4679bReferences: Sharing Features: Efficient Boosting Procedures for Multiclass Object Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=745b455dd1efbe9b93130fe437cec3d2A Trainable System for Object Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5dd7a851a794aeb35d9ee26858421ed4A Bayesian Approach to Unsupervised One-Shot Learning of Object Categories. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0261bc4d5f80548dfe6a579a09734579Simplified support vector decision rules http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=12ea54cba354e6c0f8824ec966b19cddAn Experimental Study on Pedestrian Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=accb6a16170ea96ef1ff2d60bece8481Learning The Discriminative Power-Invariance Trade-Off http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5fd8f3ed11917d0576b16217f09991baImproved Fast Gauss Transform and Efficient Kernel Density Estimation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a726e06f6db9af44772998e543df625dImproved Fast Gauss Transform and Efficient Kernel Density Estimation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1b84ff6fb949741c3969dca60aab25ccHierarchical classification and feature reduction for fast face detection with support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0c29e619fbc6b08cc594798d238c0501Building Support Vector Machines with Reduced Classifier Complexity http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e077004e278e3082e6d218cbb77b459bDetecting and localizing edges composed of steps, peaks and roofs http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=67d885959e7012f07763c828ac151441Detecting and localizing edges composed of steps, peaks and roofs http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8c2c7b543d331e38e67cdda5085cb0a2Computationally efficient face detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e948c08865ef06ca7f89c6f73edcd24cBuilding kernels from binary strings for image matching http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=383b0db02750119dc67bd745a67992edReal-time Accurate Object Detection using Multiple Resolutions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d3de7083d748fe248c5845534ded15a4Generalized Histogram Intersection Kernel for Image Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5183e89833f265ca53fe593fe676b61aLearning Additive Models Online with Fast Evaluating Kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7531872b5a89fc08d3f857085f2852b9Learning Additive Models Online with Fast Evaluating Kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fc80fc9d7d33fb234305106c74e1790bSupport vector machines for histogram-based image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5b22b8f6a125bdf4116c7456ac0960fe
