name: Support vector machine with adaptive parameters in financial time series forecastingurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM18244595public_in: 万方authors: Cao, L.J., Tay, F.E.H.,abstract: A novel type of learning machine called support vector machine  (SVM) has been receiving increasing interest in areas ranging from its original application in pattern recognition to other applications such as regression estimation due to its remarkable generalization performance. This paper deals with the application of SVM in financial time series forecasting. The feasibility of applying SVM in financial forecasting is first examined by comparing it with the multilayer back-propagation (BP) neural network and the regularized radial basis function (RBF) neural network. The variability in performance of SVM with respect to the free parameters is investigated experimentally. Adaptive parameters are then proposed by incorporating the nonstationarity of financial time series into SVM. Five real futures contracts collated from the Chicago Mercantile Market are used as the data sets. The simulation shows that among the three methods, SVM outperforms the BP neural network in financial forecasting, and there are comparable generalization performance between SVM and the regularized RBF neural network. Furthermore, the free parameters of SVM have a great effect on the generalization performance. SVM with adaptive  parameters can both achieve higher generalization performance and use  fewer support vectors than the standard SVM in financial forecastingcitations_number: 762Citation: Particle swarm optimization for parameter determination and feature selection of support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5ec07d86624ceb75f704498b387f9af5Time Series Prediction Using Support Vector Machines: A Survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a79927ed51624eac3b0064835efa47c6Applying support vector machines to predict building energy consumption in tropical region http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=af1cb9392b61f3ad06f7b651c0486122Using support vector machines for long-term discharge prediction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=84ef8b254681eff873b55f6c1d6b6019Financial time series forecasting using independent component analysis and support vector regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=12b8366ebe7b307109643d19e68f4a20Support vector echo-state machine for chaotic time-series prediction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2f577e986a738cf84b15653caa659cb9Support vector echo-state machine for chaotic time-series prediction. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0688b1cfe6dddfd9faeeb2e5bbc7f034Parameter determination of support vector machine and feature selection using simulated annealing approach http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d2e4b9a053fca7768e7099275abd2d99Parallel sequential minimal optimization for the training of support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e6c3a1797a34f9457d6946c8a6016c47Pattern discovery of fuzzy time series for financial prediction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=804bd8b6400e47133af6f8416d93958bReferences: Application of support vector machines in financial time series forecasting http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d152a735f92bbe228d4c134cbff3c1c3Extracting support data for a given task http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8c6d264ed3c1a6c55fe034331f12c99cPredicting time series with support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e9bad9f7b1e95f02b76e6ac8369f9f04Nonlinear prediction of chaotic time series using support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=83aef60916b197abb16ffb6f0fd5cbf6Some anomalous evidence regarding market efficiency http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3f63ea1f5aea912d03744069864eaa22A nonparametric approach to pricing and hedging derivative securities via learning networks http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cd996bf73b381a1237ac02da3350584aDesigning a neural network for forecasting financial and economic time series http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f47b0704d983623d56a20e57e44bdfafApplied Statistics and Probability for Engineers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1295c2f341172185be8e72b3d88af92dStock market prediction system with modular neural networks http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fe1b1b53a92ee4768bb7d832912cc896Financial Forecasting Using Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=143fa6e4f547070be2b4097d354ca048Neural network forecasting of the British Pound\/US Dollar exchange rate http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8d18984b1f0153c550f87dacba5baaa5A case study on using neural networks to perform technical forecasting of forex http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b74fd2aec48625aeb7ebff753868522cIntroduction to financial forecasting http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=944629711b90ca4039228ddc5177274aOverfitting and neural networks: conjugate gradient and backpropagation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d90388557d909cb30b421f39c0dc1c53Overfitting and Neural Networks: Conjugate Gradient and Backpropagation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4144ac3c6b21d69190a8750ea1183034A neural network approach to mutual fund net asset value forecasting http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f4d0833a8ac51e3079b784ec0f5dac7cNon-linear financial time series forecasting -
