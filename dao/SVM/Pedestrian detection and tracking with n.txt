name: Pedestrian detection and tracking with night visionurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/4008008_Pedestrian_detection_and_tracking_with_night_visionpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Fujimura,Kikuo,abstract: This paper presents a method for pedestrian detection and tracking using a single night-vision video camera installed on the vehicle. To deal with the nonrigid nature of human appearance on the road, a two-step detection/tracking method is proposed. The detection phase is performed by a support vector machine (SVM) with size-normalized pedestrian candidates and the tracking phase is a combination of Kalman filter prediction and mean shift tracking. The detection phase is further strengthened by information obtained by a road-detection module that provides key information for pedestrian validation. Experimental comparisons (e.g., grayscale SVM recognition versus binary SVM recognition and entire-body detection versus upper-body detection) have been carried out to illustrate the feasibility of our approach.citations_number: 543Citation: Survey of pedestrian detection for advanced driver assistance systems
