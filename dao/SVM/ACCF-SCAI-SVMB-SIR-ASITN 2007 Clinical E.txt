A Report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation Task Force on Clinical Expert Consensus Documents (ACCF/SCAI/SVMB/SIR/ASITN Clinical Expert Consensus Document Committee on Carotid Stenting)url: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM17451093public_in: 万方authors: Eric R. Bates,Joseph D. Babb,Donald E. Casey,abstract: Stroke is considered as the third leading cause of death in the US, behind heart disease and cancer, there are 1 million stroke-related deaths each year, including 500,000 new strokes, 200,000 recurrent strokes, and 240,000 transient ischemic attacks (TIA). The patients with temporary retinal or hemispheric neurological deficits should be screened for extracranial carotid artery disease. Non invasive imaging technique is a useful tool to assess carotid stenosis severity and guide treatment. Carotid duplex is the most widely available and least expensive non invasive imaging procedure. Cardiovascular risk factor modification is recommended to limit the progression of atherosclerosis and disease clinical events and antiplatelet therapy is recommended for symptomatic patients.citations_number: 445Citation: Endarterectomy versus stenting in patients with symptomatic severe carotid stenosis. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0cded68174540e68a47e1c52a5c2453aAspirin and Extended-Release Dipyridamole versus Clopidogrel for Recurrent Stroke \u2014 NEJM http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=482738a74fe78c16c4fe7c959b219bb5Analysis of 1008 Consecutive Patients Aged 15 to 49 With First-Ever Ischemic Stroke The Helsinki Young Stroke Registry http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d32676bbba376352cc8c3d74cc69ca86Network meta-analysis: simultaneous meta-analysis of common antiplatelet regimens after transient ischaemic attack or stroke http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ec67f006d8e15987ac93dddc016b5f90ESVS Guidelines.
