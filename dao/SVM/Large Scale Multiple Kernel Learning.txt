name: Large Scale Multiple Kernel Learningurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221996914_Large_Scale_Multiple_Kernel_Learning?ev=pub_citpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: SONNENBURG,S.,abstract: While classical kernel-based learning algorithms are based on a single kernel, in practice it is often desirable to use multiple kernels. Lanckriet et al. (2004) considered conic combinations of kernel matrices for classification, leading to a convex quadratically constrained quadratic program. We show that it can be rewritten as a semi-infinite linear program that can be efficiently solved by recycling the standard SVM implementations. Moreover, we generalize the formulation and our method to a larger class of problems, including regression and one-class classification. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm works for hundred thousands of examples or hundreds of kernels to be combined, and helps for automatic model selection, improving the interpretability of the learning result. In a second part we discuss general speed up mechanism for SVMs, especially when used with feature maps as appear for string kernels, allowing us to train a string kernel SVM on a 10 million real-world splice data set from computational biology. We integrated multiple kernel learning in our machine learning toolbox for which the source code is publicly available at .citations_number: 1327Citation: Learning to predict where humans look http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2964b50deeb80f6d2e5a5322be5c72f7On feature combination for multiclass object classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c7d1a7c6283c15fea5f2257842f80a99Multiple Kernel Learning Algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4b5eaf8b81682322ba25e45541ed81f2Simplemkl http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b496d7b74c49e33b433befff447a37b0Learning The Discriminative Power-Invariance Trade-Off http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5fd8f3ed11917d0576b16217f09991baOptimization with Sparsity-Inducing Penalties http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fee654224b8a79ce52077f4a57b3e9b8Automatic classification of patients with Alzheimer's disease from structural MRI: a comparison of ten methods using the ADNI database http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=98ea1c6fc01dfc88b70697f98a202e0bHierarchical spatio-temporal context modeling for action recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=553e0c487e39846c20d56aea71f9f4a8More generality in efficient multiple kernel learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cbe32091bea9a331978316569adc6e65Learning and Classification of Malware Behavior http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=26f360b52788aefabe1a877cb05da53fReferences: Choosing Multiple Parameters for Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f0b5df497d87b2ce12d5881a7113a946Convex optimization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1e9fd5075f3bfdc6cbd615f0f9d21ebaMaking large-scale support vector machine learning practical http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d173cb9f98a78ed94ab46461e4ac0185The spectrum kernel: a string kernel for SVM protein classification. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c4feaadff2e7f5a561825906b4b49af0Semi-Infinite Programming: Theory, Methods, and Applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=565b2e3075ed306819a1df8393792011Trie memory http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=093e3bb62a29da7b2b08a62be8466286A statistical framework for genomic data fusion http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ddd98a451fb406eee2eb4eb43897ebe7Engineering support vector machine kernels that recognize translation initiation sites http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4cc0a0fd57057fdf83002e211eebf902An Introduction to Boosting and Leveraging http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=89ba034b8a6261c633e15619df956fc2Adaptive Scaling for Feature Selection in SVMs. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e6ffa7be7e903d9d516cb83761af25b6Matrix Exponential Gradient Updates for On-line Learning and Bregman Projection. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3c3fdc8f89cc14be7b525233971d0c65Learning interpretable SVMs for biological sequence classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f824ef22b923f5acc1677c3ea89f4c3bFeature selection for splice site prediction: A new method using EDA-based feature ranking http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=978d99f12eadab808a1136e4e98b2d53MARK:a boosting algorithm for heterogeneous kernel models http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a2796f69b98f69b2be984cca8f7a8f32Column-generation boosting methods for mixture of kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7020c9b1fcc3425ac713539c53a7bd50Robust boosting via convex optimization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9d79a307b0fb6d92c5deddce2dc239cbTotally corrective boosting algorithms that maximize the margin http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=48929aefcaae3fe842803644f23214dbSparse Regression Ensembles in Infinite and Finite Hypothesis Spaces http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5a472604c55af8ecc6e0a4942019cbc3Efficient Margin Maximizing with Boosting http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=62e6aee95b53b1714e23a93186aa5325
