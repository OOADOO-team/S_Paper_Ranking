Osuna,R. Freund,and F. Girosi,abstract: We investigate the application of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in computer vision. SVM is a learning technique developed by V. Vapnik and his team (AT\&amp;T Bell Labs.) that can be seen as a new method for training polynomial, neural network, or Radial Basis Functions classifiers. The decision surfaces are found by solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming problem. This optimization problem is challenging because the quadratic form is completely dense and the memory requirements grow with the square of the number of data points.We present a decomposition algorithm that guarantees global optimality, and can be used to train SVMcitations_number: 4241Citation: LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b1552ffd60e8a942090f6dfadd26687Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6246d04e842bf1219447cef5c357a6a6Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=80fd293244903d8233327d0e5ba6de62A comparison of methods for multiclass support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b9cd4bfb4d07c34b416308b85ebf97a1GradientBased Learning Applied to Document Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3d52bb6e9ca0ad1905de25f445cdc395A Comparison of Methods for Multiclass Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1be26f8d6e2f32156cda4d10c6807e66\u5173\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9ff9531735d1c3074a95810c88dfd009Making large-scale support vector machine learning practical http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d173cb9f98a78ed94ab46461e4ac0185Working Set Selection Using Second Order Information for Training Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f5b8426229b0f88f7d2cd0b1273d29efSupport vector machines for histogram-based image classification. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=166aeb4cc5fd24ee3e129acde3158edfReferences: Human face detection in a complex background http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c12290354388768365fd038ca3b21076Simplified support vector decision rules http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=12ea54cba354e6c0f8824ec966b19cddLarge-Scale Linearly Constrained Optimization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7c04dd2ba6a78f00d73b71f2d92d5e29Determination of face position and pose with a learned representation based on labelled graphs \u2606 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6f4e0fc43cd799924154632a28bc2160An original approach for the localization of objects in images http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4aab025f1eac1d334bfeaf31bf97b715Detection and localization of faces on digital images http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ad09c4143fbac22484ed2e8480aaca34
