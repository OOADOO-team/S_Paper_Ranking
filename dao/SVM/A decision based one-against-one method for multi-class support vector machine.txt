name: A decision based one-against-one method for multi-class support vector machineurl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10044-004-0213-6public_in: Springerauthors: R. Debnath, N. Takahide, H. Takahashi,abstract: The support vector machine (SVM) has a high generalisation ability to solve binary classification problems, but its extension to multi-class problems is still an ongoing research issue. Among the existing multi-class SVM methods, the one-against-one method is one of the most suitable methods for practical use. This paper presents a new multi-class SVM method that can reduce the number of hyperplanes of the one-against-one method and thus it returns fewer support vectors. The proposed algorithm works as follows. While producing the boundary of a class, no more hyperplanes are constructed if the discriminating hyperplanes of neighbouring classes happen to separate the rest of the classes. We present a large number of experiments that show that the training time of the proposed method is the least among the existing multi-class SVM methods. The experimental results also show that the testing time of the proposed method is less than that of the one-against-one method because of the reduction of hyperplanes and support vectors. The proposed method can resolve unclassifiable regions and alleviate the over-fitting problem in a much better way than the one-against-one method by reducing the number of hyperplanes. We also present a direct acyclic graph SVM (DAGSVM) based testing methodology that improves the testing time of the DAGSVM method.citations_number: 193Citation: Applications of Support Vector Machines in Chemistry http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=70dc46018ff6efb0b63b548ee38b5b8a\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u591a\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d926a1d727587414788963964d22ff65Robust face recognition under partial occlusion based on support vector machine with local Gaussian summation kernel http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=162db55cb71fae5f01251dd476e57315Hilbert-Huang transform based physiological signals analysis for emotion recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2e262a71e6fd745d1d1c531f55402fe0Nesting One-Against-One Algorithm Based on SVMs for Pattern Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=190d2b5fe06f0664e531f5c7eb905135Using Coding-Based Ensemble Learning to Improve Software Defect Prediction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=86834753e034914ecc204a46927eb783Vibrant fault diagnosis for hydroelectric generator units with a new combination of rough sets and support vector machine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cef3632fd123ad6704f1fcacd90a185bDecentralized fault detection and diagnosis via sparse PCA based decomposition and Maximum Entropy decision fusion http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a4337927ee0e347b09cfdde1ff923511Semi-supervised discriminative classification with application to tumorous tissues segmentation of MR brain images http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bd3a9f7614634147dc211a99e889977fUnbalanced Decision Trees for multi-class classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fbf5c4bf50b688f1e347184234420eb3References: A comparison of methods for multiclass support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b9cd4bfb4d07c34b416308b85ebf97a1Fast training of support vector machines using sequential minimal optimization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4bc5a6fda23d490ceca1dcc02fcf62b5A Comparison of Methods for Multiclass Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1be26f8d6e2f32156cda4d10c6807e66An Efficient Boosting Algorithm for Combining Preferences http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=eb0c7b83268770ac20bff86ab6a88866Classification by Pairwise Coupling http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=619dd64d0e846ccc2d7d1dad4236c247Pairwise classification and support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c18fefa1742e2a2482a5814b753e5d63On the Learnability and Design of Output Codes for Multiclass Problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c60bb2062862f38758df8593e46d4813Multicategory Support Vector Machines, Theory, and Application to the Classification of Microarray Data and Satellite Radiance Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8e4f6edcb3cc4c46ebf8a3e47d7a52a2Fuzzy least squares support vector machines for multiclass problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ae66096429c78f4b3483f9420587b29aUniversal Learning Curves of Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7afec5d39bf1bf07b36cfcabd1705272Data-dependent structural risk minimisation for perceptron decision trees http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=826ac30447fdd50560edd637d6f03223An efficient boosting algorithm for combining preferences http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=836f0043032300925f3e7f84e87183e8Classification by pairwise coupling http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f77ecf82837ec7cab1020932069cd34eOn the Learnability and Design of Output Codes for Multiclass Problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0801f88cddc57979fb78666e2ac82ecf
