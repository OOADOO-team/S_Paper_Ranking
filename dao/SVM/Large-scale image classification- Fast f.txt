name: Large-scale image classification: Fast feature extraction and SVM trainingurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221361511_Large-scale_imagepublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Lin,Zhu,Yang,abstract: Most research efforts on image classification so far have been focused on medium-scale datasets, which are often defined as datasets that can fit into the memory of a desktop (typically 4G∼48G). There are two main reasons for the limited effort on large-scale image classification. First, until the emergence of ImageNet dataset, there was almost no publicly available large-scale benchmark data for image classification. This is mostly because class labels are expensive to obtain. Second, large-scale classification is hard because it poses more challenges than its medium-scale counterparts. A key challenge is how to achieve efficiency in both feature extraction and classifier training without compromising performance. This paper is to show how we address this challenge using ImageNet dataset as an example. For feature extraction, we develop a Hadoop scheme that performs feature extraction in parallel using hundreds of mappers. This allows us to extract fairly sophisticated features (with dimensions being hundreds of thousands) on 1.2 million images within one day. For SVM training, we develop a parallel averaging stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) algorithm for training one-against-all 1000-class SVM classifiers. The ASGD algorithm is capable of dealing with terabytes of training data and converges very fast–typically 5 epochs are sufficient. As a result, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet 1000-class classification, i.e., 52.9% in classification accuracy and 71.8% in top 5 hit rate.citations_number: 253Citation: ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7c535b03f1c730282182f525a307453cImage Classification with the Fisher Vector: Theory and Practice http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=86d965669f1251e22525771855dfc04aEvaluating knowledge transfer and zero-shot learning in a large-scale setting http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1907e6098993b05647005bba226edafeDepth kernel descriptors for object recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cd9ee9b84a5ef7c8e91bb355af57b844Towards good practice in large-scale learning for image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a3abb13c10c946150b052c3f0f00f842Object-Centric spatial pooling for image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5e02789a27b6a5f04677544d17844a49Good Practice in Large-Scale Learning for Image Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ba1eb276481eaa8537b2289d0ac55782Object-Centric Spatial Pooling for Image Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b9268d6f6af566a83517ff5d7410a8dObject-Centric Spatial Pooling for Image Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3292645ed8b64477752a3354cc07334fMetric learning for large scale image classification: generalizing to new classes at near-zero cost http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6f685405a751809e01614483fb1e99fdReferences: Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=80fd293244903d8233327d0e5ba6de62GradientBased Learning Applied to Document Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3d52bb6e9ca0ad1905de25f445cdc395A Comparative Study of Texture Measures with Classification Based on Feature Distributions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4f6f0126c834a7d122de775cd4a8bae7The 2005 PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ef2de41cfd916b79dfba868b8c80f6c9Training linear SVMs in linear time http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6564feba203c56d36db06dd733612ce0Pegasos: Primal Estimated sub-GrAdient SOlver for SVM http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d19c179365153d7743cf5aab07472191Map-reduce for machine learning on multicore http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bda49c9a5af0be9c5678b3bb5438e4a5LabelMe: A Database and Web-Based Tool for Image Annotation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3f7951e1eb9ea067a7cb7a39b958e5b0Solving large scale linear prediction problems using stochastic gradient descent algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1a5ea83cca5a2b2804e1fb583d70df08
