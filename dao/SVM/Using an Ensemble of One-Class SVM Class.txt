name: Using an Ensemble of One-Class SVM Classifiers to Harden Payload-based Anomaly Detection Systemsurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/220765814_Using_an_Ensemble_of_One-Class_SVM_Classifiers_to_Harden_Payload-based_Anomaly_Detection_Systemspublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Perdisci, Roberto,Gu, Guofei,Lee, Wenke,abstract: Unsupervised or unlabeled learning approaches for network anomaly detection have been recently proposed. In particular, recent work on unlabeled anomaly detection focused on high speed classification based on simple payload statistics. For example, PAYL, an anomaly IDS, measures the occurrence frequency in the payload of n-grams. A simple model of normal traffic is then constructed according to this description of the packets&#039; content. It has been demonstrated that anomaly detectors based on payload statistics can be &quot;evaded&quot; by mimicry attacks using byte substitution and padding techniques. In this paper we propose a new approach to construct high speed payload-based anomaly IDS intended to be accurate and hard to evade. We propose a new technique to extract the features from the payload. We use a feature clustering algorithm originally proposed for text classification problems to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. Accuracy and hardness of evasion are obtained by constructing our anomaly-based IDS using an ensemble of one-class SVM classifiers that work on different feature spaces.citations_number: 175Citation: BotHunter: detecting malware infection through IDS-driven dialog correlation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=08a39270ed4eb8a53da9ec00c41d1e80BotHunter: Detecting Malware Infection Through IDSDriven Dialog Correlation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f67d6febde6fe04052eccf448677b211McPAD: A multiple classifier system for accurate payload-based anomaly detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=269d850b5ec7eec722f614dc6bacc42fDetecting algorithmically generated malicious domain names http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ac0204c0b97225a009cb3d7339a075d8Traffic Aggregation for Malware Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=26311fa8d8f21d21ce1a5a24684a0dc8Traffic Aggregation for Malware Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8179d4b7b1b305b2aeda347c2dcad7edNetwork Anomaly Detection: Methods, Systems and Tools http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5440b570adab3869fbde46640870d8dfClassification of packed executables for accurate computer virus detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dac59f793e9ca59b433254c1603b3ba6Mcboost: Boosting Scalability In Malware Collection And Analysis Using Statistical Classification Of Executables http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=35a46e3f96c16cd351365ac8d4c28b99A Survey of Recent Trends in One Class Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a38d1b294e3e4a3841f456697bf78114References: A Geometric Framework for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c584c193e153bae4b9f0e3c191b6269bAnomalous Payload-Based Network Intrusion Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c4882e9ae1c9c1a2109f5cfad5a21a91Mimicry attacks on host-based intrusion detection systems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9d0ccbaa6cb97e7e79e438f0fd434495Person identification using multiple cues http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ac4c0e5eb83798437eca2df1b20365d1Text Categorization with Support Vector Machines.
