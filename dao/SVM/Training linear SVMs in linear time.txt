name: Training linear SVMs in linear timeurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221653970_Training_linear_SVMs_in_linear_timepublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Thorsten Joachims,abstract: ABSTRACT Linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have become one of the most prominent machine learning techniques for high-dimensional sparse data commonly encountered in applications like text classification, word-sense disambiguation, and drug design. These applications involve a large number of examples n as well as a large number of features N, while each example has only s &lt;&lt; N non-zero features. This paper presents a Cutting Plane Algorithm for training linear SVMs that provably has training time 0(s,n) for classification problems and o(sn log (n))for ordinal regression problems. The algorithm is based on an alternative, but equivalent formulation of the SVM optimization problem. Empirically, the Cutting-Plane Algorithm is several orders of magnitude faster than decomposition methods like svm light for large datasets.citations_number: 1765Citation: LIBLINEAR: A Library for Large Linear Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a3fe9da36ff3056948f663b10aeae1acAnomaly detection:A survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7a81abe1f0600f51d7e18a42f6442524Vlfeat: an open and portable library of computer vision algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=aa3acaf941768b77a92ea5aaa1cf293bPegasos: Primal Estimated sub-GrAdient SOlver for SVM http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d19c179365153d7743cf5aab07472191Pedestrian Detection: An Evaluation of the State of the Art http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=484460277f448fe1390d74c58c5af83eRandom features for large-scale kernel machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fe74554714747d31dfe0d0b4421efbe8Cutting-plane training of structural SVMs http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=89d31a15aa09826faae2706f7088bfc2Large-Scale Machine Learning with Stochastic Gradient Descent http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a6884a9d311c2a9de282ac54a65f2d5eThe tradeoffs of large scale learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=923dd5d3e54e94c69912e8409b63599bEfficient additive kernels via explicit feature maps. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3f37e97734b9526cbdb34d5496f310d5References: The Cutting-Plane Method for Solving Convex Programs http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4d8842ad69458eae534bb5e0bd028335SVMTorch: support vector machines for large-scale regression problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d73d941ff03709380fd407d1b644d45SVMTorch: support vector machines for large-scale regression problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=60a9069d18c3f025967de4fee051828eCore Vector Machines: Fast SVM Training on Very Large Data Sets http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e4ca8bf97ffae4df047036967ecb1de7Multicategory proximal support vector machine classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1d15c90b43eac9e303d102de41ba3642Lagrangian support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e88e123fe313e65f395e3ad2ae9de157A support vector method for multivariate performance measures http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=120973e416def793d770d41c2c9962a0A Modified Finite Newton Method for Fast Solution of Large Scale Linear SVMs http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9c7c972157a68994d690d056ae934d2bInterior-Point Methods for Massive Support Vector Machines. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=691da4cc0509b9b6f26966e4c185927ePolynomial-Time Decomposition Algorithms for Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c44acfd943ca359d0babfde1e9ce5e44Learning to Align Sequences: A Maximum-Margin Approach http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=da19e9308dca5124f508fbb9a3c627e0Learning to Align Sequences: A Maximum-Margin Approach http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=06b4024a601ed6f46055a74f65582c61KDD-Cup 2004:results and analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1a05f48cc8e9ec2e0654d5ffad5299a1Proximal support vector machine classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6bd14c2c4762634c3220e2499c7b811aCore Vector Machines: Fast SVM Training on Very Large Data Sets. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a870e6aad0696c5d8482f92b8a8787a9
