name: Support Vector Machines: Training and Applicationsurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2592728_Support_Vector_Machines_Training_and_Applicationspublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Edgar Osuna,Robert Freund,Federico Girosi,abstract: The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a new  and very promising classification technique  developed by Vapnik and his group at AT&amp;T  Bell Labs. This new learning algorithm can be  seen as an alternative training technique for  Polynomial, Radial Basis Function and Multi-Layer Perceptron classifiers. An interesting  property of this approach is that it is an  approximate implementation of the Structural  Risk Minimization (SRM) induction principle.  The derivation of Support Vector Machines, its  relationship with SRM, and its geometrical  insight, are discussed in this paper. Training  a SVM is equivalent to solve a quadratic  programming problem with linear and box  constraints in a number of variables equal to  the number of data points. When the number  of data points exceeds few thousands the  problem is very challenging, because the  quadratic form is completely dense, so the  memory needed to store the problem grows  with the square of the number of data points.  Therefore, training problems arising in some  real applications with large data sets are  impossible to load into memory, and cannot  be solved using standard non-linear  constrained optimization algorithms. We  present a decomposition algorithm that can  be used to train SVM&#039;s over large data sets.  The main idea behind the decomposition is  the iterative solution of sub-problems and the  evaluation of, and also establish the stopping  criteria for the algorithm. We present previous  approaches, as well as results and important  details of our implementation of the algorithm  using a second-order variant of the Reduced  Gradient Method as the solver of the sub-problems. As an application of SVM&#039;s, we  present preliminary results we obtained  applying SVM to the problem of detecting  frontal human faces in real images.citations_number: 1016Citation: LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b1552ffd60e8a942090f6dfadd26687In Defense of One-Vs-All Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1cb6ad251520eb88ba4e0d79c20b564eIn Defense of One-Vs-All Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8aa30a211347dae1675e58e1a4b00bffNonlinear prediction of chaotic time series using support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=83aef60916b197abb16ffb6f0fd5cbf6A Trainable System for Object Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5dd7a851a794aeb35d9ee26858421ed4Training a Support Vector Machine in the Primal http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=904694598f6f1c294f96163f072897e7Support Vector Machines: Theory and Applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=be865e23f2cfc49e299dc71c30e57f28Drug design by machine learning: support vector machines for pharmaceutical data analysis. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=237f8eda0403b90810d7760b3e5836e8References: Nonlinear Programming: Theory and Algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bc65079f36de3778cc310cd32b393299Discriminant Adaptive Nearest Neighbor Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d687401aa00881116d19fa1a1369b3a5Nonlinear Programming.
