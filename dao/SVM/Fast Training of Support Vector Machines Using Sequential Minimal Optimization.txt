Platt,abstract: This chapter describes a new algorithm for training Support Vector Machines: Sequential Minimal Optimization, or SMO. Training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) requires the solution of a very large quadratic programming (QP) optimization problem. SMO breaks this QP problem into a series of smallest possible QP problems. These small QP problems are solved analytically, which avoids using a time-consuming numerical QP optimization as an inner loop. The amount of memory required for SMO is linear in the training set size, which allows SMO to handle very large training sets. Because large matrix xomputation is avoided, SMO scales somewhere between linear and quadratic in the training set size for various test problems, while a standard projected conjugate gradient (PCG) chunking algorithm scales somehwere between linear and cubic in the training set size. SMO&#039;s computation time is dominated by SVM evaluation, hence SMO is fastest for linear SVMs and sparse data sets. For the MNIST database, SMO is as fast as PCG chunking; while for the UCI Adult database and linear SVMs, SMO can be more than 1000 times faster than the PCG chunking algorithm.citations_number: 7117Citation: LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b1552ffd60e8a942090f6dfadd26687A comparison of methods for multiclass support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b9cd4bfb4d07c34b416308b85ebf97a1Learning with kernels : http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c46f9be11358ddc22442d3bda73941f9A Comparison of Methods for Multiclass Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1be26f8d6e2f32156cda4d10c6807e66Statistical pattern recognition: a review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=079121efa11798514b67b66d00de4289New support vector algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3d26c7b685bc5ac5e82b6f03992a6b74Learning from Imbalanced Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=53206051b7c6b12d6ec7ad914bea41edOn the algorithmic implementation of multiclass kernel-based vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a08f2b97b6d527cb618c83e7c67aeddbReferences: Toward information extraction: identifying protein names from biological papers. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c254bf99e7a33c6516db07dc3ab63ff8The UMLS project: making the conceptual connection between users and the information they need. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b0ae25961b0d7b40e618391e6aaa0abfBioABACUS:a database of abbreviations and acronyms in biotechnology and computer science http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dfdf062559db08c200eb04eaa324bdc8The effect of abbreviations on MEDLINE searching http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fded9036b8ca00b099597af774b390b9
