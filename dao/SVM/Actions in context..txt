name: Actions in context.url: http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000005206557public_in: yadda.icm.edu.plauthors: Marszalek, Marcin,Laptev, Ivan,Schmid, Cordelia,abstract: This paper exploits the context of natural dynamic scenes for human action recognition in video. Human actions are frequently constrained by the purpose and the physical properties of scenes and demonstrate high correlation with particular scene classes. For example, eating often happens in a kitchen while running is more common outdoors. The contribution of this paper is three-fold: (a) we automatically discover relevant scene classes and their correlation with human actions, (b) we show how to learn selected scene classes from video without manual supervision and (c) we develop a joint framework for action and scene recognition and demonstrate improved recognition of both in natural video. We use movie scripts as a means of automatic supervision for training. For selected action classes we identify correlated scene classes in text and then retrieve video samples of actions and scenes for training using script-to-video alignment. Our visual models for scenes and actions are formulated within the bag-of-features framework and are combined in a joint scene-action SVM-based classifier. We report experimental results and validate the method on a new large dataset with twelve action classes and ten scene classes acquired from 69 movies.citations_number: 841Citation: A survey on vision-based human action recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3d812e44988ba5dce01bc2f51f01fa8aAction recognition by dense trajectories http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c437aebd0ae72590e8cb4c9baf6bf98aAction Recognition with Improved Trajectories http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f95900d16cab6792ce12d1cea71d68f63D Convolutional Neural Networks for Human Action Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c3334731b15df7d6c911584dce0a9262UCF101: A Dataset of 101 Human Actions Classes From Videos in The Wild http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0ba439e7a23d8268b15def66d76a38c7Dense Trajectories and Motion Boundary Descriptors for Action Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b76912509347fdaee39528e9bb53b693Learning hierarchical invariant spatio-temporal features for action recognition with independent subspace analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c176b3642666514df7c3773d2e435678Modeling temporal structure of decomposable motion segments for activity classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1c69d0cd075eb44c2b289c30a93582b6Learning a hierarchy of discriminative space-time neighborhood features for human action recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b05d9582e2fb4f080be6c4f144ac19b6Convolutional Learning of Spatio-temporal Features http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9229ee31e16b2b84198ece840a095700References: Contextual Priming for Object Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=80f6d7e23c229f2fd0985b4ec3035431Scene perception: detecting and judging objects undergoing relational violations. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bce88b03fc3f45111a07d8fa8d98f8f8What, where and who?
