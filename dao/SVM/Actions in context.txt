Human actions are frequently constrained by the purpose and the physical properties of scenes and demonstrate high correlation with particular scene classes. For example, eating often happens in a kitchen while running is more common outdoors. The contribution of this paper is three-fold: (a) we automatically discover relevant scene classes and their correlation with human actions, (b) we show how to learn selected scene classes from video without manual supervision and (c) we develop a joint framework for action and scene recognition and demonstrate improved recognition of both in natural video. We use movie scripts as a means of automatic supervision for training. For selected action classes we identify correlated scene classes in text and then retrieve video samples of actions and scenes for training using script-to-video alignment. Our visual models for scenes and actions are formulated within the bag-of-features framework and are combined in a joint scene-action SVM-based classifier. We report experimental results and validate the method on a new large dataset with twelve action classes and ten scene classes acquired from 69 movies.citations_number: 908Citation: A survey on vision-based human action recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3d812e44988ba5dce01bc2f51f01fa8aAction recognition by dense trajectories http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c437aebd0ae72590e8cb4c9baf6bf98aAction Recognition with Improved Trajectories http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f95900d16cab6792ce12d1cea71d68f63D Convolutional Neural Networks for Human Action Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c3334731b15df7d6c911584dce0a9262UCF101: A Dataset of 101 Human Actions Classes From Videos in The Wild http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0ba439e7a23d8268b15def66d76a38c7HMDB: a large video database for human motion recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ddc796566dfeb42dc7d3b1f516606d77Dense Trajectories and Motion Boundary Descriptors for Action Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b76912509347fdaee39528e9bb53b693Learning hierarchical invariant spatio-temporal features for action recognition with independent subspace analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c176b3642666514df7c3773d2e435678Modeling temporal structure of decomposable motion segments for activity classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1c69d0cd075eb44c2b289c30a93582b6Learning a hierarchy of discriminative space-time neighborhood features for human action recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b05d9582e2fb4f080be6c4f144ac19b6References: Learning with Kernels: Support Vector Machines, Regularization, Optimization, and Beyond http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cade818d721bebf55aeebb235b8e0cf1Learning With Kernels: Support Vector Machines, Regularization, Optimization, and Beyond http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1b8868ce9d0c5c76646fa859f4b99fb3Local Features and Kernels for Classification of Texture and Object Categories: A Comprehensive Study http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=86a35f9917e82cabd8d8e30805e122ebBehavior recognition via sparse spatio-temporal features http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dffc681a66de7aa43632ba7973e590b8Unsupervised Learning of Human Action Categories Using Spatial-Temporal Words http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=84d5cac4213a12062d92c106e5fe7d2fContextual Priming for Object Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=80f6d7e23c229f2fd0985b4ec3035431Scene perception: detecting and judging objects undergoing relational violations. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bce88b03fc3f45111a07d8fa8d98f8f8What, where and who?
