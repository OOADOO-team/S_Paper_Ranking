name: Support vector machines for face authenticationurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0262885602000094public_in: Elsevierauthors: K. Jonsson,J. Kittler,Y.P. Li,abstract: We present an extensive study of the support vector machine (SVM) sensitivity to various processing steps in the context of face authentication. In particular, we evaluate the impact of the representation space and photometric normalisation technique on the SVM performance. Our study supports the hypothesis that the SVM approach is able to extract the relevant discriminatory information from the training data. We believe that this is the main reason for its superior performance over benchmark methods (e.g. the eigenface technique). However, when the representation space already captures and emphasises the discriminatory information content (e.g. the fisherface method), the SVMs cease to be superior to the benchmark techniques. The SVM performance evaluation is carried out on a large face database containing 295 subjects.citations_number: 294Citation: Recent advances in visual and infrared face recognition\u2014a review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8a4e303559ac42e072b039a956800d10Face verification across age progression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=256ea3ffa34a3ca68bbe36814e332728A SURVEY ON PATTERN RECOGNITION APPLICATIONS OF SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0de3cc6e23ebf6e7e34a2cd4d89b3d72Gabor wavelets and General Discriminant Analysis for face identification and verification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=786c025ace2f3d92f0347ddb48ad11edSupport vector machines for face authentication http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=88528a5c8a3b431567e8a6b1d027609dApplications of Support Vector Machines for Pattern Recognition: A Survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4055019980b65024e8a8a8add793f4dbApplications of Support Vector Machines for Pattern Recognition: A Survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3d92d798187f72c266e4298e90ad4424A survey of 3d face recognition methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=70372cf92cd7efa26fc2ced401e747e4Color image watermark extraction based on support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d8a9bc6646e749bc7189158d105bb6b7A Study of Face Recognition as People Age. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2439bf0dc2d0bd9747104547af24f5d3References: Distortion Invariant Object Recognition in the Dynamic Link Architecture http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=895ccfad414147b41e36f3ac2f2708eeDeformable templates for face recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2847449e1d1a7f10ed732407b2f8aa6bDeformable Templates for Face Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=808b4bab391b37865d8b262140a4ba64Support vector machines applied to face recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6c046b82f75be6623f52439ab6565a3dBeyond eigenfaces: probabilistic matching for face recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bbeee1927f23ed96f4e78cf771115395Beyond Eigenfaces: Probabilistic Matching for Face Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=144ade48fb14ab147ef3af0c696da011Beyond Eigenfaces: Probabilistic Matching for Face Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d398777f330c1eba72011cec0ff245d4Probabilistic matching for face recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=412f2d9d48b664ee431e6187eb727ad9Support vector machines for face authentication http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=88528a5c8a3b431567e8a6b1d027609dEffective Implementation of Linear Discriminant Analysis for Face Recognition and Verification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4da286350187dea2c27067769dc63b69Effective Implementation of Linear Discriminant Analysis for Face Recognition and Verification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=05fc9b7c506abb81d7f87b4fb152831dEffective Implementation of Linear Discriminant Analysis for Face Recognition and Verification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=69bf969ceaec325457295aa8e959ed0b
