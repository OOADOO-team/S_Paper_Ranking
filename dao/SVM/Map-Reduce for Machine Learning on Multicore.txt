name: Map-Reduce for Machine Learning on Multicoreurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221617998_Map-Reduce_for_Machine_Learning_on_Multicore?ev=prf_citpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: YiAn Lin,abstract: We are at the beginning of the multicore era. Computers will have increasingly many cores (processors), but there is still no good programming framework for these architectures, and thus no simple and unified way for machine learning to take advantage of the potential speed up. In this paper, we develop a broadly applicable parallel programming method, one that is easily applied to many different learning algorithms. Our work is in distinct contrast to the tradition in machine learning of designing (often ingenious) ways to speed up a single algorithm at a time. Specifically, we show that algorithms that fit the Statistical Query model [15] can be written in a certain ‘summation form,’ which allows them to be easily parallelized on multicore computers. We adapt Google&#039;s map-reduce [7] paradigm to demonstrate this parallel speed up technique on a variety of learning algorithms including locally weighted linear regression (LWLR), k-means, logistic regression (LR), naive Bayes (NB), SVM, ICA, PCA, gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA), EM, and backpropagation (NN). Our experimental results show basically linear speedup with an increasing number of processors.citations_number: 1223Citation: Distributed Optimization and Statistical Learning via the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f1f38796a7d5ec1f2998a5e2a2c2ef1dSpark: cluster computing with working sets http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a9427d87cad994e9baa5f75300e21fd4Resilient distributed datasets: a fault-tolerant abstraction for in-memory cluster computing http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=249e7a0a8687e63334527fb10655efe2Twister:a runtime for iterative MapReduce http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8cb91985549bcfae0c46f6dd3bc9d29eData mining with big data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f2497a3b81186d6e2bbd6f5d82fe2f49Mars: A MapReduce Framework on graphics processors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=60d18ec692ea1c90b15c34391c9cf4b7GraphLab: A New Framework For Parallel Machine Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4e90d4a7bc0349de1c062c3416fd9797MapReduce for Data Intensive Scientific Analyses. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=61b1d9e41c5a6e2721180d5859571a11Distributed GraphLab: a framework for machine learning and data mining in the cloud http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=607e5f345943a87c488e81478169b41fSparse Online Learning via Truncated Gradient http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c5597447118fb9ca7a9c08635e76a34eReferences: An analysis of Bayesian classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7ecb76ca85b98bffc44cd946589ed4e4Logistic Regression Diagnostics http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=08a31dddea727dd1d4feb21e21b762deEfficient noise-tolerant learning from statistical queries http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=089dfd6b2ecd5db656515ccdfc6aff3bAn expectation maximization algorithm http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fd429e758ab9f71fa0746bcf2d492385Progress in digital integrated electronics http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7a6b87cbe33269706887298c5ca262a8Software and the Concurrency Revolution http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e82becf8f40c51362218b886f8409ca4Fast parallel matrix inversion algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=96b37f0c2cdb171641ca0cf99a614eebLinear Regression Diagnostics http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5a1d477b82109a12b5591bca0fc8f484Fast parallel matrix inversion algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=10f795e475fe67ca20ddb1caf79c87b0Microprocessors for the new millennium: Challenges, opportunities, and new frontiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=071ba4907ded544f32a1e9b23da1e4c6Shared Memory Parallelization of Data Mining Algorithms: Techniques, Programming Interface, and Performance http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=18defa8a0188cdb87587265bcbfce4a5Power-constrained CMOS scaling limits http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=462be776f594970bbcbc38bb5f2cb16bA Framework for Learning from Distributed Data Using Sufficient Statistics and its Application to Learning Decision Trees. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=89951ae0f9c0e3a449581fe549b9d161Power-constrained CMOS scaling limits http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=58c524f20bc68963d35704e9700ea32b
