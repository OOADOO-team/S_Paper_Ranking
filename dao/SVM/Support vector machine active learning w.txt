name: Support vector machine active learning with applications to text classificationurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221345901_Support_Vector_Machine_Active_Learning_with_Application_sto_Text_Classificationpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Tong, Simon,Koller, Daphne,abstract: Support vector machines have met with significant success in numerous real-world learning tasks. However, like most machine learning algorithms, they are generally applied using a randomly selected training set classified in advance. In many settings, we also have the option of using . Instead of using a randomly selected training set, the learner has access to a pool of unlabeled instances and can request the labels for some number of them. We introduce a new algorithm for performing active learning with support vector machines, i.e., an algorithm for choosing which instances to request next. We provide a theoretical motivation for the algorithm using the notion of a . We present experimental results showing that employing our active learning method can significantly reduce the need for labeled training instances in both the standard inductive and transductive settings.citations_number: 2598Citation: Machine learning in automated text categorization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=197fcab33ebe33ad22d0e8b510a42ae4Relevance feedback in image retrieval: A comprehensive review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d6f76e8c9e005a7327dbfdf0638ad2a4Core Vector Machines: Fast SVM Training on Very Large Data Sets. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a870e6aad0696c5d8482f92b8a8787a9Interactive deduplication using active learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=14140874f83bbf537107aad7223f99f0\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2226686f009d7df75daee53447a54ba5Fast Kernel Classifiers With Online And Active Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8cbcf909d07acdc22aad13ba959715d7Human computation: a survey and taxonomy of a growing field http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=79de9c8b29e8abda186aab7454165038Classifying Large Data Sets Using SVM with Hierarchical Clusters http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a930b63bbd945bc5126f59e39e4f281eActive learning using pre-clustering http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=93d26ab60bd8109201de31d242781662Online Choice of Active Learning Algorithms. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c337d3d6078bc77cb7a97322fa457c15References: Selective Sampling Using the Query by Committee Algorithm http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c8b17a9c0fe3ad98b2f7efb6ba29e65cQuery by committee http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a5a44482c064cabbf5b9fba2adaba80eIncremental and Decremental Support Vector Machine Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3eef2e10526d9ac6bcdcb1512ca34ebbQuery by Committee http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0e40f2a172237f236a7caff9e669067aEmploying EM and Pool-Based Active Learning for Text Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=07c9df176f0889a999c8f42598311b88Less is More: Active Learning with Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=24abebd5a287c37b43a125b1eed68043Heterogeneous Uncertainty Sampling for Supervised Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fcfb5ba1b7d4a56d5c8483843cd77452Query Learning with Large Margin Classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5f2d26707c6a23f11d4c14f342964163Committee-Based Sampling For Training Probabilistic Classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5b28534a2a4fac0b8c3fafca020af1b8Bayes point machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5610e2293b1f1e5619941ecb877b6d23PAC-Bayesian model averaging http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=754aac6dd16c66df3a4467fe34582c02Active learning with committees for text categorization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=907c11b908f73efaf2cb2ac74f0e8f5fTime-Dependent Utility and Action Under Uncertainty http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e716d6fb9b2bdc8eede96b64d5818555Further Results on the Margin Distribution http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9284c4effd1f2f94bf42d7c5753ec3f6Bayes Point Machines: Estimating the Bayes Point in Kernel Space http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f8975f221d9abd2c8a136e327583bb88Active learning with committees http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6e61a34d8bd76b2dc318963f20dc774dActive learning with committees: an approach to efficient learning in text categorization using linear threshold algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e1857a03bd38eb042fffa81b420a3049
