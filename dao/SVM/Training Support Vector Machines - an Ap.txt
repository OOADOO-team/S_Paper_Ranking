name: Training Support Vector Machines : an Application to Face Detectionurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2464475_Training_Support_Vector_Machines_an_Application_to_Face_Detectionpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Osunat, Edgar,Freund, Robert,abstract: We investigate the application of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in computer vision. SVM is a learning technique developed by V. Vapnik and his team (AT&amp;T Bell Labs., 1985) that can be seen as a new method for training polynomial, neural network, or Radial Basis Functions classifiers. The decision surfaces are found by solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming problem. This optimization problem is challenging because the quadratic form is completely dense and the memory requirements grow with the square of the number of data points. We present a decomposition algorithm that guarantees global optimality, and can be used to train SVM&#039;s over very large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of optimality conditions which are used both to generate improved iterative values, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present experimental results of our implementation of SVM, and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a face detection problem that involves a data set of 50,000 data points.citations_number: 4215Citation: LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b1552ffd60e8a942090f6dfadd26687Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6246d04e842bf1219447cef5c357a6a6GradientBased Learning Applied to Document Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3d52bb6e9ca0ad1905de25f445cdc395A Comparison of Methods for Multiclass Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1be26f8d6e2f32156cda4d10c6807e66Working Set Selection Using Second Order Information for Training Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f5b8426229b0f88f7d2cd0b1273d29efIn Defense of One-Vs-All Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1cb6ad251520eb88ba4e0d79c20b564eLearning to detect objects in images via a sparse, part-based representation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bf6dd22f660e76d95e4f97f9f63b190cHead pose estimation in computer vision: a survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1cad997efb58cc44415348d98dd41451Classification using intersection kernel support vector machines is efficient http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=20e99a5a65c74f9bc426372844dfd5ebCore Vector Machines: Fast SVM Training on Very Large Data Sets. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a870e6aad0696c5d8482f92b8a8787a9References: Example Based Learning for View-Based Human Face Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=507fd55aca629af54c45bfc17ee5119dExample-Based Learning for View-Based Human Face Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9cc16cc32d00cfa95626fbded29d3cb4Human face detection in a complex background http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c12290354388768365fd038ca3b21076Support vector machines: Training and applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a9510c9b33d7c27d96fcdfed403be7caSimplified support vector decision rules http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=12ea54cba354e6c0f8824ec966b19cddProbabilistic visual learning for object detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d9efbde629482950d03ba89823ac462Large-Scale Linearly Constrained Optimization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7c04dd2ba6a78f00d73b71f2d92d5e29Determination of face position and pose with a learned representation based on labelled graphs \u2606 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6f4e0fc43cd799924154632a28bc2160An original approach for the localization of objects in images http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4aab025f1eac1d334bfeaf31bf97b715Original approach for the localisation of objects in images http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=78defbbe3d09496ffa49e6852faa9271Support vector machines: training and applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cc4a4a4faf642ee18309ee3011de35d5
