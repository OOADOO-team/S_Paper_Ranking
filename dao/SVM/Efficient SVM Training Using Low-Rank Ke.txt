name: Efficient SVM Training Using Low-Rank Kernel Representationsurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/262351084_Efficient_svm_training_using_low-rank_kernel_representationspublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Shai Fine,Katya Scheinberg,Nello Cristianini,abstract: SVM training is a convex optimization problem which scales with the training set size rather than the feature space dimension. While this is usually considered to be a desired quality, in large scale problems it may cause training to be impractical. The common techniques to handle this difficulty basically build a solution by solving a sequence of small scale subproblems. Our current effort is concentrated on the rank of the kernel matrix as a source for further enhancement of the training procedure. We first show that for a low rank kernel matrix it is possible to design a better interior point method (IPM) in terms of storage requirements as well as computational complexity. We then suggest an efficient use of a known factorization technique to approximate a given kernel matrix by a low rank matrix, which in turn will be used to feed the optimizer. Finally, we derive an upper bound on the change in the objective function value based on the approximation error and the number of active constraints (support vectors). This bound is general in the sense that it holds regardless of the approximation method.citations_number: 713Citation: LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b1552ffd60e8a942090f6dfadd26687LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=309e25e4e7d5ca5cbe656208c220a1afKernel independent component analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8e507fb79163beebde4c84e4b44e33e0Pegasos: Primal Estimated sub-GrAdient SOlver for SVM http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d19c179365153d7743cf5aab07472191Pedestrian Detection: An Evaluation of the State of the Art http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=484460277f448fe1390d74c58c5af83eCore Vector Machines: Fast SVM Training on Very Large Data Sets http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e4ca8bf97ffae4df047036967ecb1de7Gaussian processes for machine learning \/ http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=20f73cdb8b10dc884f65b042da2943f1Efficient additive kernels via explicit feature maps. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3f37e97734b9526cbdb34d5496f310d5Efficient additive kernels via explicit feature maps http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e22696ba35f2d233657cc6ced56a1d5bTraining a Support Vector Machine in the Primal http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=904694598f6f1c294f96163f072897e7References: A training algorithm for optimal margin classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fcee14409ac8673a3c41b818a716878dFast training of support vector machines using sequential minimal optimization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4bc5a6fda23d490ceca1dcc02fcf62b5Making large-scale support vector machine learning practical http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d173cb9f98a78ed94ab46461e4ac0185An improved training algorithm for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=139c8d7a401089d7e94702e27cad2875Exploiting Generative Models in Discriminative Classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=12c87bed87e18b83b651f51a354e4aa9Using the Nystr\u00f6m method to speed up kernel machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1204114af7a52e2da6c8a6301453ae48On the Implementation of a Primal-Dual Interior Point Method http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a5659ef176492beea666240a5b03b57fSparse Greedy Matrix Approximation for Machine Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2082dd75ea92027f8cacc9801eb183c3The Kernel-Adatron Algorithm: A Fast and Simple Learning Procedure for Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fcef67189e1befbb9bdbe4df36b5b48bGeneralization performance of regularization networks and support vector machines via entropy numbers of compact operators http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ea50718ef4d5343b8a3acd2e30de5de6A hybrid GMM\/SVM approach to speaker identification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c2bfb1bc496374b5a3f6e5e33d615f1eMethods for Computing and Modifying the $LDV$ Factors of a Matrix http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c1c742705e429314ffb1b46697189113Triangular factors of modified matrices http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d1487360302e33201d4de1c38d813afcOn the Modification of $LDL^T$ Factorizations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=375c997b246622309cb8e70605579f58Modified Cholesky Factorizations in Interior-Point Algorithms for Linear Programming http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0bfeb13ed420187da4200469503690d5A modified Schur-complement method for handling dense columns in interior-point methods for linear programming http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3e4acc1767b8c00ccb49c41bb40f9083Natural Regularization from Generative Models http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2899f6b096a07eb4b3a4fe3c04d68f90Natural Regularization from Generative Models http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ba35f31f1cefeb6e0218fd9a7c1a9b47Making large-scale support vector machine learning practical http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8b2ee071fb1bb4270b5fdd78491da269
