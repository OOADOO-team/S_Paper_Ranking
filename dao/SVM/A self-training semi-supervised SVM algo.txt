name: A self-training semi-supervised SVM algorithm and its application in an EEG-based brain computer interface speller systemurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016786550800055Xpublic_in: Elsevierauthors: Yuanqing Li,Cuntai Guan,Huiqi Li,abstract: In this paper, we first present a self-training semi-supervised support vector machine (SVM) algorithm and its corresponding model selection method, which are designed to train a classifier with small training data. Next, we prove the convergence of this algorithm. Two examples are presented to demonstrate the validity of our algorithm with model selection. Finally, we apply our algorithm to a data set collected from a P300-based brain computer interface (BCI) speller. This algorithm is shown to be able to significantly reduce training effort of the P300-based BCI speller.citations_number: 178Citation: Unsupervised brain computer interface based on intersubject information and online adaptation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=65dd3ee4577f439ba064cca57334cbbcEEG-Based Brain-Controlled Mobile Robots: A Survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a215be43b6158458b4bd97780aee1511Unsupervised brain computer interface based on inter-subject information http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7af915648540294be9a0779db9eedb76Learning from other subjects helps reducing Brain-Computer Interface calibration time http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=df5cd1ec0a5528d2dcb11587e744942cFrequency recognition in SSVEP-based BCI using multiset canonical correlation analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0e1d9deb6f97ce64f038ce0010ee863bA Bayesian Model for Exploiting Application Constraints to Enable Unsupervised Training of a P300-based BCI http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=244a397e96896c67d0a2ae3268e02b2bA multiple kernel framework for inductive semi-supervised SVM learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4a0c66b2381137d371be171ac3e5650bPattern classification and clustering: A review of partially supervised learning approaches http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=12f382fb33a584cd21e12618cbe8e095Semi-supervised learning based on nearest neighbor rule and cut edges http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1028b82a010a55b9e12e4bb1f1d7c6dcCombining active learning and semi-supervised learning to construct SVM classifier http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=59619b05c3086d1401d003c23c183e5dReferences: Transductive Inference for Text Classification using Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6301f4fbd109ade166381062fa93cf55Transductive Inference for Text Classification using Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=36360d9d15b6c46485f4986a4b05df50Talking off the top of your head: toward a mental prosthesis utilizing event-related brain potentials. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f7c6dd2fa14fbb6deccea0b991f3780aA spelling device for the paralysed. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6f41d5752ca9e54cd71d4017e39770eaAnalyzing the effectiveness and applicability of co-training http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5b4b1e3b80e8c9d0e7b24ac6fa7e09f4Semi-supervised support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9130a5c6a977596ee68f31e7fd20b93eTransductive learning via spectral graph partitioning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0bf3df75fb30862ebe441fff66be3a50Presidential address, 1980.
