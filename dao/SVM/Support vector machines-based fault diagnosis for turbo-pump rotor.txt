name: Support vector machines-based fault diagnosis for turbo-pump rotorurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888327005001433public_in: Elsevierauthors: ShengFa Yuan,FuLei Chu,abstract: Most artificial intelligence methods used in fault diagnosis are based on empirical risk minimisation principle and have poor generalisation when fault samples are few. Support vector machines (SVM) is a new general machine-learning tool based on structural risk minimisation principle that exhibits good generalisation even when fault samples are few. Fault diagnosis based on SVM is discussed. Since basic SVM is originally designed for two-class classification, while most of fault diagnosis problems are multi-class cases, a new multi-class classification of SVM named ‘one to others’ algorithm is presented to solve the multi-class recognition problems. It is a binary tree classifier composed of several two-class classifiers organised by fault priority, which is simple, and has little repeated training amount, and the rate of training and recognition is expedited. The effectiveness of the method is verified by the application to the fault diagnosis for turbo pump rotor.citations_number: 260Citation: Support vector machine in machine condition monitoring and
