name: The use of small training sets containing mixed pixels for accurate hard image classification: training on mixed spectral responses for classification by a SVMurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425706001350public_in: Elsevierauthors: Foody, Giles M,Mathur, Ajay,abstract: The accuracy of a supervised image classification is a function of the training data used in its generation. It is, therefore, critical that the training stage of a supervised classification is designed to provide the necessary information. Guidance on the design of the training stage of a classification typically calls for the use of a large sample of randomly selected pure pixels in order to characterise the classes. Such guidance is generally made without regard to the specific nature of the application in-hand, including the classifier to be used. The design of the training stage should really be based on the classifier to be used since individual training cases can vary in value as can any one training set to a range of classifiers. It is argued here that the training stage can be designed on the basis of the way the classifier operates and with emphasis on the desire to separate the classes rather than describe them. An approach to the training of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier that is the opposite of that generally promoted for training set design is suggested. This approach uses a small sample of mixed spectral responses drawn from purposefully selected locations (geographical boundaries) in training. The approach is based on mixed pixels which are normally masked-out of analyses as undesirable and problematic. A sample of such data should, however, be easier and cheaper to acquire than that suggested by conventional approaches. This new approach to training set design was evaluated against conventional approaches with a set of classifications of agricultural crops from satellite sensor data. The main result was that classifications derived from the use of the mixed spectral responses and the conventional approach did not differ significantly, with the overall accuracy of classifications generally âˆ¼ 92%.citations_number: 282Citation: Fusion of Support Vector Machines for Classification of Multisensor Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=36b4a11030198890423462890e0bb2d5Cross-border Comparison of Post-socialist Farmland Abandonment in the Carpathians http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fdd0d62711905f2a6c671ee093158e5fA Survey of Active Learning Algorithms for Supervised Remote Sensing Image Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e52ce1c6f43c1cd524744870897909a6Training set size requirements for the classification of a specific class http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6d385ccad2b693d0f35430b34f6c0ff2Cross-border Comparison of Post-socialist Farmland Abandonment in the Carpathians http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6d59e5ed49ca83f5ebc7e455b2667e94Land cover mapping of large areas using chain classification of neighboring Landsat satellite images http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=468744437ebcd793a19b2f29c8624645Support vector machines regression for retrieval of leaf area index from multiangle imaging spectroradiometer http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1cdaa000e947c16c7302272f1c787903Forest cover change and illegal logging in the Ukrainian Carpathians in the transition period from 1988 to 2007 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0cb8ea805203bcbef68561ebd41a72fdFeature Selection and Classification of Hyperspectral Images With Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7937557d39bdd75af88b4c64a3ae210dContribution of multispectral and multitemporal information from MODIS images to land cover classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=55f813028986433ce0de724f149f646bReferences: Classification of hyperspectral remote sensing images with support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=302d09839efa8d5f2df65ef43aa5f82cClassification and change detection using landsat TM data : When and how to correct atmospheric effects?
