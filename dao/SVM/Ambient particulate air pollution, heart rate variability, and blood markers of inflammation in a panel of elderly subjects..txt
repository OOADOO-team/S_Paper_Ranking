Although the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms remain unclear, it has been hypothesized that altered autonomic function and pulmonary/systemic inflammation may play a role. In this study we explored the effects of air pollution on autonomic function measured by changes in heart rate variability (HRV) and blood markers of inflammation in a panel of 88 elderly subjects from three communities along the Wasatch Front in Utah. Subjects participated in multiple sessions of 24-hr ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and blood tests. Regression analysis was used to evaluate associations between fine particulate matter [aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm ( PM2.5)] and HRV, C-reactive protein (CRP), blood cell counts, and whole blood viscosity. A 100-μ g/ m3increase in PM2.5was associated with approximately a 35 (SE = 8)-msec decline in standard deviation of all normal R-R intervals (SDNN, a measure of overall HRV); a 42 (SE = 11)-msec decline in square root of the mean of the squared differences between adjacent normal R-R intervals (r-MSSD, an estimate of short-term components of HRV); and a 0.81 (SE = 0.17)-mg/dL increase in CRP. The PM2.5- HRV associations were reasonably consistent and statistically robust, but the CRP association dropped to 0.19 (SE = 0.10) after excluding the most influential subject. PM2.5was not significantly associated with white or red blood cell counts, platelets, or whole-blood viscosity. Most short-term variability in temporal deviations of HRV and CRP was not explained by PM2.5; however, the small statistically significant associations that were observed suggest that exposure to PM2.5may be one of multiple factors that influence HRV and CRP.citations_number: 403Citation: Health effects of fine particulate air pollution: lines that connect. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c79a4dc4ea9b819d73a60fc6d119ab90Particulate Matter Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Disease http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c4000b9e0e9c1f86b41e53b1b9a4d2d9Fine particulate air pollution and hospital admission for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f54ee3f6d3db45d5e2064d2a360887aaTaylor & Francis Online :: Health Effects of Fine Particulate Air Pollution: Lines that Connect - Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association - Volume 56, Issue 6 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ba7530a83569f3f9c78378e3209f5b03Exposure to traffic and the onset of myocardial infarction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=63f0eed3903bbe6e96b589cc61fde12aEnvironmental Cardiology Studying Mechanistic Links Between Pollution and Heart Disease http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9b591f686f11afa009c4bfdea914b460Potential role of ultrafine particles in associations between airborne particle mass and cardiovascular health. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dba0b65747d64d40b856acf4bcd6d78fAdverse cardiovascular effects of air pollution. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7aaa0ffba8e554611f21a660e9cfa893Ischemic heart disease events triggered by short-term exposure to fine particulate air pollution. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=15e517a23c89918b5a3e4bb3b5aa30caReprogramming of a melanoma genome by nuclear transplantation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6b5ad724571bd2a2c77e42e93f470bf4References: Particulate air pollution and acute health effects http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4a0cc70c1eac082f1e36b2fc3e702dd2Prospective Study of Heart Rate Variability and Mortality in Chronic Heart Failure Results of the United Kingdom Heart Failure Evaluation and Assessment of... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7c5d3a328d3752425e3510e37eb8f4eaAcute inflammatory responses in the airways and peripheral blood after short-term exposure to diesel exhaust in healthy human volunteers. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ead0f0f4afbf536e9a304438eda69e84Epidemiology of fine particulate air pollution and human health: biologic mechanisms and who's at risk? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=53e10232d50c437fae84ffc38441aba7Ambient pollution and heart rate variability. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7c9b29e26c24d306dde8812bf80c0c64Short-Term Heart Rate Variability Strongly Predicts Sudden Cardiac Death in Chronic Heart Failure Patients http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=40635079f5072325a8db8804cc65a8a8Association of heart rate variability with occupational and environmental exposure to particulate air pollution http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=71c4a1d4ef63ff5683588ecc1490a174Increased plasma viscosity during an air pollution episode: a link to mortality? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1cc34cd8cf966dcf9859ff8dbef416dcDaily variation of particulate air pollution and poor cardiac autonomic control in the elderly. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=06c266f56f948f6aa8a89d541799ba1fParticulate air pollution is associated with an acute phase response in men.
