Felzenszwalb,David A. McAllester,Deva Ramanan,abstract: This paper describes a discriminatively trained, multiscale, deformable part model for object detection. Our system achieves a two-fold improvement in average precision over the best performance in the 2006 PASCAL person detection challenge. It also outperforms the best results in the 2007 challenge in ten out of twenty categories. The system relies heavily on deformable parts. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL challenge. Our system also relies heavily on new methods for discriminative training. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM, like a hidden CRF, leads to a non-convex training problem. However, a latent SVM is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. We believe that our training methods will eventually make possible the effective use of more latent information such as hierarchical (grammar) models and models involving latent three dimensional pose.citations_number: 1179Citation: Robust Object Tracking with Online Multiple Instance Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4a88b6fd53bf7aba18a942b5c42a33d2Describing objects by their attributes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6f993bbdcacce007c7e49f8fae8f6cf6Pedestrian Detection: An Evaluation of the State of the Art http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=484460277f448fe1390d74c58c5af83eLearning to detect unseen object classes by between-class attribute transfer http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=80a762e1901f08efd29c4d6d1942ebd9Learning To Detect Unseen Object Classes by Between-Class Attribute Transfer http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=861afa003748bf47dadb2fe3a015fd4eLearning to predict where humans look http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2964b50deeb80f6d2e5a5322be5c72f7Classification using intersection kernel support vector machines is efficient http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=20e99a5a65c74f9bc426372844dfd5ebPoselets: Body part detectors trained using 3D human pose annotations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f5d914ceaf9f1f48f42efe1fc7394bdeReferences: Distance transforms of sampled functions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6b1c52aef5681994383f11b34ba4c8d0Object Detection Using the Statistics of Parts http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=94a3fb253d0c70c589816f4ef588a0bcSpatial Priors for Part-Based Recognition Using Statistical Models http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d6b4917704c0c2007424362e14c17f92The 2005 PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b26c46045e40011b415694084f355f05Hidden Conditional Random Fields http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=245c7194a2121975bf771890e4e96f64A Probabilistic Approach to Object Recognition Using Local Photometry and Global Geometry http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=96e08a00ff96e0aad79207819a0c7300Probabilistic Methods for Finding People http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1abd5a1c5b9063e63f7c5e20b3a5fdb3A probabilistic approach to object recognition using local photometry and global geometry http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=005fc4010c4fb890f7a4bb57c827f1b6Weakly supervised learning of part-based spatial models for visual object recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=64861dd5014417b9562204accf672b25Weakly Supervised Learning of Part-Based Spatial Models for Visual Object Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ee190b4108fc082faf83f316ab0152c0Context and Hierarchy in a Probabilistic Image Model http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dc52bad9866daa03956cb4ea4ae63a13POP: Patchwork of Parts Models for Object Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2085f42e8d56c59eac4b8003d20e83a4Training Deformable Models for Localization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b28b846974d1885dd9633c1adf604d5dUsing Segmentation to Verify Object Hypotheses http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6bc39449021fdf146d5d4379ed2531ccThe Generalized A* Architecture http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bc88c679de0f13dd1fdfcad4d4f3bd3dA Discriminative Framework for Modelling Object Classes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=875ee964835faf1ca66a1e3186c6b2f2Semantic Hierarchies for Recognizing Objects and Parts http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=aff831d8824b9c7d3c88f5a897b3e71aThe generalized A* architecture http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ea7a23f8b002bc927ede47888e3eb41aTraining Deformable Models for Localization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3ab8d91d0cc2458a85fb8818f646ce93A discriminative framework for modelling object classes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0ef14c9e5b3ba75fb6c3e1940f663c7b
