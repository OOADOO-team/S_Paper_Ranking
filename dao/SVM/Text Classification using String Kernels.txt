name: Text Classification using String Kernelsurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2536408_Text_Classification_using_String_Kernelspublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Lodhi, Huma,Saunders, Craig,Shawe-Taylor, John,abstract: We propose a novel approach for categorizing text documents based on the use of a special kernel. The kernel is an inner product in the feature space generated by all subsequences of length k. A subsequence is any ordered sequence of k characters occurring in the text though not necessarily contiguously. The subsequences are weighted by an exponentially decaying factor of their full length in the text, hence emphasising those occurrences that are close to contiguous. A direct computation of this feature vector would involve a prohibitive amount of computation even for modest values of k, since the dimension of the feature space grows exponentially with k. The paper describes how despite this fact the inner product can be efficiently evaluated by a dynamic programming technique. Experimental comparisons of the performance of the kernel compared with a standard word feature space kernel (Joachims, 1998) show positive results on modestly sized datasets. The case of contiguous subsequences is also considered for comparison with the subsequences kernel with different decay factors. For larger documents and datasets the paper introduces an approximation technique that is shown to deliver good approximations efficiently for large datasets.citations_number: 1712Citation: Text classification using string kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3ee4341d15fead1aae34072af1b0ce17Kernel Methods for Relation Extraction. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=19a6589f68b433fb87c7feef82288b19Dependency tree kernels for relation extraction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fb9f538a8093e8c07b9b838883574ac9Dimensionality reduction of multimodal labeled data by local Fisher discriminant analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fd049b1dd5ca402f8de4f730237ed2e3Multiple Kernel Learning Algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4b5eaf8b81682322ba25e45541ed81f2New ranking algorithms for parsing and tagging: kernels over discrete structures, and the voted perceptron http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fda866abba4ddec704bf45b7c72e95dcOn Graph Kernels: Hardness Results and Efficient Alternatives http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e6d456620e6c7a2be7d0b346b2711e41On Graph Kernels: Hardness Results and Efficient Alternatives http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1b41d840fbea334ee3affbd460025445\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2226686f009d7df75daee53447a54ba5Mismatch string kernels for discriminative protein classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=222a7428b4d8fece073fc047816b51ddReferences: Functions of Positive and Negative Type, and their Connection with the Theory of Integral Equations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9c96421e71eaec3d60fc91e5be69196aText classification using string kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3ee4341d15fead1aae34072af1b0ce17Using the Nystr\u00f6m method to speed up kernel machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1204114af7a52e2da6c8a6301453ae48Input space versus feature space in kernel-based methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ef19aa870ff39d351e779117d1762250On kernel-target alignment http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5937c42ebbf7c1055b90c34debe30101Structural risk minimization over data-dependent hierarchies http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e0b96e99cdb22163f13012a665d74fe8Sparse Greedy Matrix Approximation for Machine Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2082dd75ea92027f8cacc9801eb183c3The Kernel-Adatron Algorithm: A Fast and Simple Learning Procedure for Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fcef67189e1befbb9bdbe4df36b5b48bOn a Connection between Kernel PCA and Metric Multidimensional Scaling http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5c349b749daaf6703cc6c62a8e4b0228Proceedings of the Seventeenth International Conference on Machine Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5b7b9f1ef374a4b421a46f419f7090a0Margin Distribution and Soft Margin http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ee43b1baf011e3888c065bcd10285279Margin Distribution and Soft Margin http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=70d0e39c9f79b9febae840b8c0cccef9Dynamic Alignment Kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b38bbc1d0734b04422f548dca9d28c16
