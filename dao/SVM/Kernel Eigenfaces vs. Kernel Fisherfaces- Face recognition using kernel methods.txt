name: Kernel Eigenfaces vs. Kernel Fisherfaces: Face recognition using kernel methodsurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/3948232_Kernel_Eigenfaces_vs._Kernel_Fisherfaces_Face_recognition_using_kernel_methodspublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Ming-Hsuan Yang,abstract: Principal Component A nalysis and Fisher Linear Discriminant methods have demonstrated their success in fac edete ction, r ecognition and tr acking. The representations in these subspace methods are based on second order statistics of the image set, and do not address higher order statistical dependencies such as the relationships among three or more pixels. Recently Higher Order Statistics and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) have been used as informative representations for visual recognition. In this paper, we investigate the use of Kernel Principal Component Analysis and Kernel Fisher Linear Discriminant for learning low dimensional representations for face recognition, which we call Kernel Eigenface and Kernel Fisherface methods.While Eigenface and Fisherface methods aim to find projection directions based on second order correlation of samples, Kernel Eigenface and Kernel Fisherface methods provide generalizations which take higher order correlations into account. We compare the performance of kernel methods with classical algorithms such as Eigenface, Fisherface, ICA, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) within the context of appearance-based face recognition problem using two data sets where images vary in pose, scale, lighting and expression. Experimental results show that kernel methods provide better representations and achieve lower error rates for face recognition.citations_number: 1079Citation: Two-Dimensional PCA: A New Approach to Appearance-Based Face Representation and Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=54c8dd1a183e3a779aa5413a17883861Face Recognition by Independent Component Analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=aec43ca40ff3ff5ac833b7d94bb67e17Face recognition using laplacianfaces. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=027347979cf2b3df24110074b4e2652eKPCA plus LDA: a complete kernel Fisher discriminant framework for feature extraction and recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fe2c94cf593fec71cd9a740029c3a7a52D-LDA: A statistical linear discriminant analysis for image matrix http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4814df04301eeaaa198045b1bfdbb10eIndependent component analysis of Gabor features for face recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=998a649fe1d29d9d2f1ba8b82e3ddee1Linear Regression for Face Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a20a486b6766727490fb37b51b501153Discriminative Learning and Recognition of Image Set Classes Using Canonical Correlations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=043bde7b265f9d2c15c93ef9926ca0e8Subclass discriminant analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c6663a9ff09aafabc563c401f445eda6Capitalize on Dimensionality Increasing Techniques for Improving Face Recognition Grand Challenge Performance http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4cb5e6c289386422ad2366c3a15ebcf8References: Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components for Face Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3ad4c80268c600df03d53ed2b38057feIndependent component representations for face recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ed69f0958eb9f1505be2666e819541b5Support vector machines applied to face recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6c046b82f75be6623f52439ab6565a3dPrincipal Manifolds and Bayesian Subspaces for Visual Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b424170d47e0030501ae5cbd954fe168Evolutionary pursuit and its application to face recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8f45d4fb51855324175c0d9455233d91Nonlinear discriminant analysis using kernel functions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cf33695d781f09c739c9a522a9df5e07Evolutionary Pursuit and Its Application to Face Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1d75058efe86d2e6137fdb2c787a82cfFace Image Analysis by Unsupervised Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8ae076ea23a383137dffb7a531152549Face Image Analysis by Unsupervised Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b6b84dd5476e48baf62fd5cf32882314Viewpoint invariant face recognition using independent component analysis and attractor networks http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0aa3a25b919fe77548beff1f0f4b76b5Hierarchical Discriminant Analysis for Image Retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=256480122221a289503a88c1e27e05ecFinding Faces in Photographs http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ca25acf6da70a88b215ae0d0c9549df6Rate-coded restricted Boltzmann machines for face recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2c97a09e94988f489fdaf48dfd5e9317Non-linear Bayesian Image Modelling http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=98c7c9bb93651f7724c09ec5a898cf01Higher Order Statistical Learning for Vehicle Detection in Images http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0f29a5ba0ae285b81ed249bd57789446PCA versus LDA. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e3b595a9eba2bbb902af6bc66e4b2e5f
