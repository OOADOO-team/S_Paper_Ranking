name: A study on reduced support vector machinesurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM18244590public_in: 万方authors: Kuan-Ming Lin, , Chih-Jen Lin, ,abstract: Recently the reduced support vector machine (RSVM) was proposed as an alternate of the standard SVM. Motivated by resolving the difficulty on handling large data sets using SVM with nonlinear kernels, it preselects a subset of data as support vectors and solves a smaller optimization problem. However, several issues of its practical use have not been fully discussed yet. For example, we do not know if it possesses comparable generalization ability as the standard SVM. In addition, we would like to see for how large problems RSVM outperforms SVM on training time. In this paper we show that the RSVM formulation is already in a form of linear SVM and discuss four RSVM implementations. Experiments indicate that in general the test accuracy of RSVM are a little lower than that of the standard SVM. In addition, for problems with up to tens of thousands of data, if the percentage of support vectors is not high, existing implementations for SVM is quite competitive on the training time. Thus, from this empirical study, RSVM will be mainly useful for either larger problems or those with many support vectors. Experiments in this paper also serve as comparisons of. 1) different implementations for linear SVM and 2) standard SVM using linear and quadratic cost functions.citations_number: 464Citation: Extreme learning machines: a survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4bf48d06b7c37584d833c5720587a7e3Building Support Vector Machines with Reduced Classifier Complexity http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e077004e278e3082e6d218cbb77b459bData Mining With Computational Intelligence http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=baed607c40e171d5ccd885b8080a042fData Mining with Computational Intelligence http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=967aeb2b7fb52e9ddbb75ed8426e5a27Reduced Support Vector Machines: A Statistical Theory http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=335f7ae142ed47e55654c842f6a206cdSupport-vector-based fuzzy neural network for pattern classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a1e815fcd4a8d7d7b492cab577e89c4f\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9cfcac05060db32188f416bca6d5a492Fast Modular network implementation for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=14e1a7733ad1f93abdafcd0ecdfaf104An Efficient Method for Gradient-Based Adaptation of Hyperparameters in SVM Models http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8a684838b3025cf705ae6d5c08414e22An Efficient Method for Gradient-Based Adaptation of Hyperparameters in SVM Models http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=86d46cb016aa614464bb21cbf569e397References: Comparing Support Vector Machines with Gaussian Kernels to Radial Basis Function Classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=aebd67933e2ab7a3926a004c60680351Lagrangian support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e88e123fe313e65f395e3ad2ae9de157SSVM: A Smooth Support Vector Machine for Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=727a0e049bae6557cdbdd9704c7c4f84Successive overrelaxation for support vector machines. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c986a2e5dbef193c7cfbc659ee17a867The Kernel-Adatron Algorithm: A Fast and Simple Learning Procedure for Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fcef67189e1befbb9bdbe4df36b5b48bGeneralized Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e330f83234aac14bc9d0c972957e0eb1A Simple Decomposition Method for Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=543acfb0eb85926c82bcaede66403d8fOn the convergence of the decomposition method for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ebac281a793039df68c1635c8184b7a3Newton's Method For Large Bound-Constrained Optimization Problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=62f3798a79d67c69bd64a94d5c887390Multiclass LS-SVMs: Moderated Outputs and Coding-Decoding Schemes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d961fa39045c66354e933a250d94dddeIJCNN 2001 challenge: generalization ability and text decoding http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c42b7a812483a53b11ea1aea23facc9dIterative equalisation-decoding scheme http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=980e5daf80991aa151f686383cb2f49fGeneralized Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=05f2bd74fcbdac9130de258fe0e6d34a
