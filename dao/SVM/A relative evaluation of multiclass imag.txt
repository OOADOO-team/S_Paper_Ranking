name: A relative evaluation of multiclass image classification by support vector machinesurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/3203495_A_relative_evaluation_of_multiclass_image_classification_by_support_vector_machinespublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: G.M. Foody,A. Mathur,abstract: Support vector machines (SVM) have considerable potential as classifiers of remotely sensed data. A constraint on their application in remote sensing has been their binary nature, requiring multi-class classifications to be based upon a large number of binary analyses. Here, an approach for multi-class classification of airborne sensor data by a single SVM analysis is evaluated against a series of classifiers that are widely used in remote sensing, with particular regard to the effect of training set size on classification accuracy. In addition to the SVM, the same data sets were classified using a discriminant analysis, decision tree and multilayer perceptron neural network. The accuracy statements of the classifications derived from the different classifiers were compared in a statistically rigorous fashion that accommodated for the related nature of the samples used in the analyses. For each classification technique, accuracy was positively related with the size of the training set. In general, the most accurate classifications were derived from the SVM approach, and with the largest training set the SVM classification was significantly (p&lt;0.05) more accurate (93.75%) than that derived from the discriminant analysis (90.00%) and decision tree algorithms (90.31%). Although each classifier could yield a very accurate classification, &gt;90% correct, the classifiers differed in the ability to correctly label individual cases and so may be suitable candidates for an ensemble based approach to classification.citations_number: 715Citation: The role of spatial scale and the perception of large\u2010scale species\u2010richness patterns
