name: Simple rules underlying gene expression profiles of more than six subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patientsurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_JJ0210055979public_in: 万方authors: Li, J., Liu, H., Downing, J. R.,abstract: Motivations and Results: For classifying gene expression profiles or other types of medical data, simple rules are preferable to non-linear distance or kernel functions. This is because rules may help us understand more about the application in addition to performing an accurate classification. In this paper, we discover novel rules that describe the gene expression profiles of more than six subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. We also introduce a new classifier, named PCL, to make effective use of the rules. PCL is accurate and can handle multiple parallel classifications. We evaluate this method by classifying 327 heterogeneous ALL samples. Our test error rate is competitive to that of support vector machines, and it is 71% better than C4.5, 50% better than Naive Bayes, and 43% better than k-nearest neighbour. Experimental results on another independent data sets are also presented to show the strength of our method.citations_number: 184Citation: Minimum Redundancy Feature Selection from Microarray Gene Expression Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d3a6bb6213304ffed676d0a723e9a694Minimum Redundancy Feature Selection from Microarray Gene Expression Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=967e5e099bb2a40044413747b03603d6Classification of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia by gene expression profiling. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=216ce9760ed589baa81c984be598fc57Data mining in bioinformatics using Weka. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5f85fc3d023537b1fe39ff0b8596b209Classification of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia by gene expression profiling http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3007f85a6158bf2c77fc0a5068770acbSupervised Descriptive Rule Discovery: A Unifying Survey of Contrast Set, Emerging Pattern and Subgroup Mining http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=44c57db57dd3f16c0cadceffb4b461e7Weka-A Machine Learning Workbench for Data Mining http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a99ae8e5ba05e0431aa69b664b19ead8Discovery of significant rules for classifying cancer diagnosis data. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3a5894de6d0bd070620c30705b9532f4Mining border descriptions of emerging patterns from dataset pairs http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bf44c37df6b91a8943d2f223c9dc3836Mining border descriptions of emerging patterns from dataset pairs http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=54220c5a192f4eb1aa582222b8a58f62References: A Tutorial on Support Vector Machines for Pattern Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=478e7ec22867ba234e18c5e17d8cd98bC4.5: programs for machine learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a7369febe35e81656153a44b08af34f9C4.5: programs for machine learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=39bf648874ee2a84052dc0e149782a20Nearest neighbor pattern classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0435eb774d9cdb5208a291e2c266579eBroad patterns of gene expression revealed by clustering analysis of tumor and normal colon tissues probed by oligonucleotide arrays http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=97d26274713fe6a145c108b42fa58280Classification, subtype discovery, and prediction of outcome in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia by gene expression profiling. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d253d7a878e93d07db8fbb044a5ccaeeMLL translocations specify a distinct gene expression profile that distinguishes a unique leukemia. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=007c3b6e9f9016b224c3328b54035116An analysis of Bayesian classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7ecb76ca85b98bffc44cd946589ed4e4Efficient mining of emerging patterns:discovering trends and differences http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dcd592be19dbf3115db272ec2ef94da9Chi2: Feature Selection and Discretization of Numeric Attributes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b64ba9b70322f829f76eca33302feebIdentifying good diagnostic gene groups from gene expression profiles using the concept of emerging patterns http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d02304571cfa63c934ce799b6a06a768A pharmacoeconomic model to aid in the allocation of ambulatory clinical pharmacy services http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=80f96f14970fd655605853a40129bb9eThe Space of Jumping Emerging Patterns and Its Incremental Maintenance Algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dcd9635c819cb726183f7ec074aa1fd1Nearest neighbor pattern classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=54c7dd7d9b72c5517c29f616e2d1e9b0
