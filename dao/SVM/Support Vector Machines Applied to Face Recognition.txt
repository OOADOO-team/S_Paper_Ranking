Jonathon Phillips,abstract: Abstract Face recognition is a K class problem, where K is the number of known individuals; and support vector machines (SVMs) are a binary classification method. By reformulating the face recognition problem and reinterpreting the output of the SVM classifier, we developed a SVM-based face recognition algorithm. The face recognition problem is formulated as a problem in difference space, which models dissimilarities between two facial images. In difference space we formulate face recognition as a two class problem. The classes are: dissimilarities between faces of the same person, and dissimilarities between faces of different people. By modifying the interpretation of the decision surface generated by SVM, we generated a similarity metric between faces that is learned from examples of differences between faces. The SVM-based algorithm is compared with a principal component analysis (PCA) based algorithm on a difficult set of images from the FERET database. Performance was measured for both verification and identification scenarios. The identification performance for SVM is 77-78% versus 54% for PCA. For verification, the equal error rate is 7% for SVM and 13% for PCA.citations_number: 523Citation: Face recognition using laplacianfaces http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a722c4eb7c8fc229784e0c3df2e66bd6Learning Gender with Support Faces http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=41de1350f4ca706728bb2f212d6c9bfaFace recognition using laplacianfaces. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=027347979cf2b3df24110074b4e2652eNeighborhood Preserving Embedding http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e8401a33674ea3ee01a459b37e85758cKernel Eigenfaces vs. Kernel Fisherfaces: Face recognition using kernel methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6a89470b3546ee743fdda93138c947cdKernel Eigenfaces vs. Kernel Fisherfaces: Face recognition using kernel methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=73751e51b413bea12188b7b821be1bc4Advances in Large-Margin Classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=de719fc44d5db570ea98d5a819b13b54Orthogonal Laplacianfaces for Face Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1a466112205b7c2a2f7459fafc4c33a2Face recognition from a single image per person: A survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a8fe53059617f7be306dd02c04675a64References: The FERET database and evaluation procedure for face recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0d4ffcc0cd4188c000b3ab8a71894c29Beyond eigenfaces: probabilistic matching for face recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bbeee1927f23ed96f4e78cf771115395Beyond Eigenfaces: Probabilistic Matching for Face Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=144ade48fb14ab147ef3af0c696da011Beyond Eigenfaces: Probabilistic Matching for Face Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d398777f330c1eba72011cec0ff245d4Face Recognition using View-Based and Modular Eigenspaces http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f70603a8d2e8ec6b3b237a6f08ef2622
