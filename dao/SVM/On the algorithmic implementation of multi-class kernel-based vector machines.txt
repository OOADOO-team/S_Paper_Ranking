name: On the algorithmic implementation of multi-class kernel-based vector machinesurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2855509_On_the_Algorithmic_Implementation_of_Multiclass_Kernel-based_Vector_Machinespublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Koby Crammer,Yoram Singer,Nello Cristianini,abstract: In this paper we describe the algorithmic implementation of multiclass kernel-based vector machines. Our starting point is a generalized notion of the margin to multiclass problems. Using this notion we cast multiclass categorization problems as a constrained optimization problem with a quadratic objective function. Unlike most of previous approaches which typically decompose a multiclass problem into multiple independent binary classification tasks, our notion of margin yields a direct method for training multiclass predictors. By using the dual of the optimization problem we are able to incorporate kernels with a compact set of constraints and decompose the dual problem into multiple optimization problems of reduced size. We describe an efficient fixed-point algorithm for solving the reduced optimization problems and prove its convergence. We then discuss technical details that yield significant running time improvements for large datasets. Finally, we describe various experiments with our approach comparing it to previously studied kernel-based methods. Our experiments indicate that for multiclass problems we attain state-of-the-art accuracy.citations_number: 1769Citation: Distance Metric Learning for Large Margin Nearest Neighbor Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0002aa875e7623ce1b1a2813c7acd59bIn Defense of One-Vs-All Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1cb6ad251520eb88ba4e0d79c20b564eOnline Passive-Aggressive Algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f2c4fcdca6f325b1b1b3d5a199afbdbbSupport Vector Machine Learning for Interdependent and Structured Output Spaces http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9734a6249963b97b2c306bdee2d88907Two-Stream Convolutional Networks for Action Recognition in Videos http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=de9c108a5e08f4f502cd6bce30e5ce9fCutting-plane training of structural SVMs http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=89d31a15aa09826faae2706f7088bfc2Simplemkl http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b496d7b74c49e33b433befff447a37b0Support Vector Machines: Theory and Applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=be865e23f2cfc49e299dc71c30e57f28Kernel Methods in Machine Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4ba954f8b0d51f1363e9fcf5709312e5References: SVMTorch: support vector machines for large-scale regression problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d73d941ff03709380fd407d1b644d45SVMTorch: support vector machines for large-scale regression problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=60a9069d18c3f025967de4fee051828eParallel Optimization: Theory, Algorithms and Applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b373b21041efbdcf7d5aa0d6990490c2Multicategory Classification by Support Vector Machines. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=551560e2cfa871856f17e5f7e9508112Multicategory Classification by Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=591c4eab4fa80e9a1e1ad45cc91c88fcRobust Trainability of Single Neurons. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=30864ece1a082069cecab731e4cffd7fA New Multi-Class SVM Based on a Uniform Convergence Result http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=26b5d0b69df989cbd88145c004f08f6b
