name: Classifying large data sets using SVMs with hierarchical clustersurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2481299_Classifying_Large_Data_Sets_Using_SVM_with_Hierarchical_Clusterspublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Jiawei Han,abstract: Support vector machines (SVMs) have been promising methods for classification and regression analysis because of their solid mathematical foundations which convery several salient properties that other methods hardly provide. However, despite the prominent properties of SVMs, they are not as favored for large-scale data mining as for pattern recognition or machine learning because the training complexity of SVMs is highly dependent on the size of a data set. Many real-world data mining applications involve millions or billions of data records where even multiple scans of the entire data are too expensive to perform. This paper presents a new method, Clustering-Based SVM (CB-SVM), which is specifically designed for handling very large data sets. CB-SVM applies a hierarchical micro-clustering algorithm that scans the entire data set only once to provide an SVM with high quality samples that carry the statistical summaries of the data such that the summaries maximize the benefit of learning the SVM. CB-SVM tries to generate the best SVM boundary for very large data sets given limited amount of resources. Our experiments on synthetic and real data sets show that CB-SVM is highly scalable for very large data sets while also generating high classification accuracy.citations_number: 336Citation: Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=92a5f38ca1bcae4831ac46e28657bc33Core Vector Machines: Fast SVM Training on Very Large Data Sets http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e4ca8bf97ffae4df047036967ecb1de7A new intrusion detection system using support vector machines and hierarchical clustering http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=03cf43d82bec9f019222a1cc049b8521Mutual information-based feature selection for intrusion detection systems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=009be505d3cd2d495ee4de0ef8f2456fRecent Advances of Large-Scale Linear Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=75873bafe2f08215ecb116e29e2b8edfLarge Linear Classification When Data Cannot Fit in Memory http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=92dc54ed5fbd66c3a7f5707b067ba752Support vector machine classification for large data sets via minimum enclosing ball clustering http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ef60d3caf1ef9c3610a90ec14b266b38Granular support vector machines with association rules mining for protein homology prediction. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3c838ede02f42f5932dcf332eb9d00a2Domain-Driven Data Mining: Challenges and Prospects http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1481acfd7eca8bd5e9ad2bb48743825eSupport vector machines with genetic fuzzy feature transformation for biomedical data classification \u2606 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6932405d385686458181d93b550baf53References: Chameleon: hierarchical clustering using dynamic modeling http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1093966484e0730084de1dfbf6541e06SVMTorch: support vector machines for large-scale regression problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d73d941ff03709380fd407d1b644d45SVMTorch: support vector machines for large-scale regression problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=60a9069d18c3f025967de4fee051828eWhen Is \u201cNearest Neighbor\u201d Meaningful? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f55f7ca2b0715a2ee49794890c350881Less is More: Active Learning with Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=24abebd5a287c37b43a125b1eed68043Training nu-support vector classifiers: theory and algorithms. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=90fee87b0e49c3cc69450c19dc671860Mining top-n local outliers in large databases http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a1c692a058c534010597ec6b0d2c4dd2PEBL:positive example based learning for Web page classification using SVM http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ef5c616113c76765c86d4aa06255c508LOGML: Log Markup Language for Web Usage Mining http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8ed7dd8de0c24da4fe4f69bfb5aa3582A Random Sampling Technique for Training Support Vector Machines. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=55cdddc39c478e4ec67b91607ec98842Shrinkage estimator generalizations of Proximal Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a0fcd8353f4372b361de2beae82ec6deA Random Sampling Technique for Training Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8109151cade01fffd665e0da6f835dc7Proximal support vector machine classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6bd14c2c4762634c3220e2499c7b811a
