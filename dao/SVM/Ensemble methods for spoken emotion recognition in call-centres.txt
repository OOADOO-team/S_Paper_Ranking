name: Ensemble methods for spoken emotion recognition in call-centresurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167639306001713public_in: Elsevierauthors: Donn Morrison,Ruili Wang,Liyanage C. De Silva,abstract: Machine-based emotional intelligence is a requirement for more natural interaction between humans and computer interfaces and a basic level of accurate emotion perception is needed for computer systems to respond adequately to human emotion. Humans convey emotional information both intentionally and unintentionally via speech patterns. These vocal patterns are perceived and understood by listeners during conversation. This research aims to improve the automatic perception of vocal emotion in two ways. First, we compare two emotional speech data sources: natural, spontaneous emotional speech and acted or portrayed emotional speech. This comparison demonstrates the advantages and disadvantages of both acquisition methods and how these methods affect the end application of vocal emotion recognition. Second, we look at two classification methods which have not been applied in this field: stacked generalisation and unweighted vote. We show how these techniques can yield an improvement over traditional classification methods.citations_number: 263Citation: Survey on speech emotion recognition: Features, classification schemes,
