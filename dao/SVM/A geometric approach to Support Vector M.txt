name: A geometric approach to Support Vector Machine (SVM) classificationurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM16722171public_in: 万方authors: Mavroforakis, M.E., Theodoridis, S.,abstract: The geometric framework for the support vector machine (SVM)  classification problem provides an intuitive ground for the understanding and the application of geometric optimization algorithms, leading to practical solutions of real world classification problems. In  this work, the notion of &quot;reduced convex hull&quot; is employed and supported  by a set of new theoretical results. These results allow existing  geometric algorithms to be directly and practically applied to solve not  only separable, but also nonseparable classification problems both  accurately and efficiently. As a practical application of the new  theoretical results, a known geometric algorithm has been employed and  transformed accordingly to solve nonseparable problems successfullycitations_number: 271Citation: Reduced Convex Hulls: A Geometric Approach to Support Vector Machines [Lecture Notes] http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d949214e8591101503d95ceaa7549965Nontechnical Loss Detection for Metered Customers in Power Utility Using Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0506395831a85f6151805994fa5718c8Online Kernel-Based Classification Using Adaptive Projection Algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=38242862cb73ff81ac3e96e4ddf2cdd0Support vector machine classification for large data sets via minimum enclosing ball clustering http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ef60d3caf1ef9c3610a90ec14b266b38Automatically Conflating Road Vector Data with Orthoimagery http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=aae5b28e5ea5ea426663bb9be0232b62Using digital holographic microscopy for simultaneous measurements of 3D near wall velocity and wall shear stress in a turbulent boundary layer http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=12d8f37097b52f46f72af35fcf2b420fAdaptive Constrained Learning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces: The Robust Beamforming Case http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=12909f76e482ec5268a354af49e666d6A \u03bd -twin support vector machine ( \u03bd -TSVM) classifier and its geometric algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c33018356203f2c044fabe576b708be8\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u6cd5\u7efc\u8ff0 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=efe45a07cf4b72b7b312f6665ceb0dceAdaptive constrained learning in reproducing Kernel Hilbert spaces: the robust beamforming case http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c49ed103e7e83a5022471a3e38fa9559References: Soft Margins for AdaBoost http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f03e203be204e3b7fb6db9460cbdc4aeAn introduction to support Vector Machines: and other kernel-based learning methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6ccdb34994c6baedc9afbd2e0af74319A fast iterative nearest point algorithm for support vector machine classifier design http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f53f633fc71e56e8bfff082426a6cf94A support vector machine approach for detection of microcalcifications in mammograms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=af37434326e311f8c3b7ecb2a47131cbA support vector machine approach for detection of microcalcifications in mammograms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ec80b7998f433f39ab51410ac10dc389Duality and Geometry in SVM Classifiers. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=02267a8f07d302ef394390c5e74fb96eSupport vector machine techniques for nonlinear equalization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a25b0aea476576caabe5b65fe8dad234Support vector machine techniques for nonlinear equalization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=64edda50cf6fe3f4206abced2fc99ec9An iterative algorithm learning the maximal margin classifier http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=908c41b232b00da9c8115b4c81bbf149Weighted least squares training of support vector classifiers leading to compact and adaptive schemes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a668483cd3435c2a410ebd1fdffe5e56Soft Margins for AdaBoost http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dd8267884372668ae3a2d4984157669a
