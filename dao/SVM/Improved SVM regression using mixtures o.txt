Smits,E.M. Jordaan,abstract: ABSTRACT  Kernels are used in support vector machines to map the learning  data (nonlinearly) into a higher dimensional feature space where the  computational power of the linear learning machine is increased. Every  kernel has its advantages and disadvantages. A desirable characteristic  for learning may not be a desirable characteristic for generalization.  Preferably the &#039;good&#039; characteristics of two or more kernels should be  combined. It is shown that using mixtures of kernels can result in  having both good interpolation and extrapolation abilities. The  performance of this method is illustrated with an artificial as well as  an industrial data setcitations_number: 493Citation: Support vector machines for hyperspectral image classification with spectral-based kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b4812d4b913113890185dc9196ba7080Missing Value Estimation for Mixed-Attribute Data Sets http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=00cf166e1e5668a17dde747286030d4dFault diagnosis based on support vector machines with parameter optimisation by artificial immunisation algorithm http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1722e4759ba36c8ff883b9e32f431d12Evolving Least Squares Support Vector Machines for Stock Market Trend Mining http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d14e47e460b19dcbc60a4145670ba93bFault diagnostics based on particle swarm optimisation and support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a5136f709836b612c88eeb73ff2b76f1\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u7684SVM\u53ca\u5176\u5e94\u7528 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c0b5f80018a84f531d0c437bb871ef6a\u4e00\u79cd\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6838\u51fd\u6570 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=688478929b234d331b438ccbe5907397Support vector regression applied to materials optimization of sialon ceramics http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=caf41fd596864db4ff19bb904c74a905\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0036ae8aa0e11d2217ee146a2da6e3a9Hybridizing mixtures of experts with support vector machines: Investigation into nonlinear dynamic systems identification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=338dd2a3d8b9f7f2eb2cc6d6fe0976ffReferences: An introduction to support Vector Machines: and other kernel-based learning methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6ccdb34994c6baedc9afbd2e0af74319The Effect of the Input Density Distribution on Kernel-based Classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=424053a8c24a9bcbd5d88d2c258a613a
