name: In Defense of One-Vs-All Classificationurl: http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2247975public_in: AMSauthors: Rifkin, Ryan,Klautau, Aldebaro,Org, Klautauieee,abstract: We consider the problem of multiclass classification. Our main thesis is that a simple &quot;one-vs-all&quot; scheme is as accurate as any other approach, assuming that the underlying binary classifiers are well-tuned regularized classifiers such as support vector machines. This thesis is interesting in that it disagrees with a large body of recent published work on multiclass classification. We support our position by means of a critical review of the existing literature, a substantial collection of carefully controlled experimental work, and theoretical arguments.citations_number: 1546Citation: Seeing stars: exploiting class relationships for sentiment categorization with respect to rating scales http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=20ab95df9a3ea702fdb6732727724ff9Learning to detect unseen object classes by between-class attribute transfer http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=80a762e1901f08efd29c4d6d1942ebd9Learning To Detect Unseen Object Classes by Between-Class Attribute Transfer http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=861afa003748bf47dadb2fe3a015fd4eGaussian processes for machine learning \/ http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=20f73cdb8b10dc884f65b042da2943f1Simplemkl http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b496d7b74c49e33b433befff447a37b0Foundations of Machine Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=819210f266a230533dd4614e1f5fe1bcAuto-Context and Its Application to High-Level Vision Tasks and 3D Brain Image Segmentation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d9337561f687f7428eab3cd48b2fa5fbWhich Is the Best Multiclass SVM Method?
