name: Less is More: Active Learning with Support Vector Machinesurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2430239_Less_is_More_Active_Learning_with_Support_Vector_Machinespublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Greg Schohn,David Cohn,abstract: We describe a simple active learning heuristic which greatly enhances the generalization behavior of support vector machines (SVMs) on several practical document classification tasks. We observe a number of benefits, the most surprising of which is that a SVM trained on a wellchosen subset of the available corpus frequently performs better than one trained on all available data. The heuristic for choosing this subset is simple to compute, and makes no use of information about the test set. Given that the training time of SVMs depends heavily on the training set size, our heuristic not only offers better performance with fewer data, it frequently does so in less time than the naive approach of training on all available data. 1.citations_number: 913Citation: Support vector machine active learning with applications to text classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=60db55eac5b1321cc15ca663f6112d3cCore Vector Machines: Fast SVM Training on Very Large Data Sets. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a870e6aad0696c5d8482f92b8a8787a9Interactive deduplication using active learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6f05c89a8c7ef550d1c5e9660511268dTraining Invariant Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=832ea83656111399cb0933511e6bd8ecFast Kernel Classifiers With Online And Active Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8cbcf909d07acdc22aad13ba959715d7Active learning using pre-clustering http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e479056b304628674b8f64779f604c14A Formal Study of Shot Boundary Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e356b1457021d86f38bd0f91b2472158Classifying Large Data Sets Using SVM with Hierarchical Clusters http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a930b63bbd945bc5126f59e39e4f281eActive learning using pre-clustering http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=93d26ab60bd8109201de31d242781662Online Choice of Active Learning Algorithms. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c337d3d6078bc77cb7a97322fa457c15References: Learning to Classify Text from Labeled and Unlabeled Documents http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=50cede1127b0632faf30640be97ca35bNonlinear optimization: complexity issues http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d39c608eb6509f21704925100eb79b98Neural Networks for Signal Processing VII : proceedings of the 1997 IEEE Signal Processing Society Workshop http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a54c28b7fa7e822ffd49645b7febfe29
