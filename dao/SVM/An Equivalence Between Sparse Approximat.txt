name: An Equivalence Between Sparse Approximation and Support Vector Machinesurl: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9698353public_in: NCBIauthors: Girosi, Federico,abstract: This article shows a relationship between two different approximation techniques: the support vector machines (SVM), proposed by V. Vapnik (1995) and a sparse approximation scheme that resembles the basis pursuit denoising algorithm (Chen, 1995; Chen, Donoho, &amp; Saunders, 1995). SVM is a technique that can be derived from the structural risk minimization principle (Vapnik, 1982) and can be used to estimate the parameters of several different approximation schemes, including radial basis functions, algebraic and trigonometric polynomials, B-splines, and some forms of multilayer perceptrons. Basis pursuit denoising is a sparse approximation technique in which a function is reconstructed by using a small number of basis functions chosen from a large set (the dictionary). We show that if the data are noiseless, the modified version of basis pursuit denoising proposed in this article is equivalent to SVM in the following sense: if applied to the same data set, the two techniques give the same solution, which is obtained by solving the same quadratic programming problem. In the appendix, we present a derivation of the SVM technique in the framework of regularization theory, rather than statistical learning theory, establishing a connection between SVM, sparse approximation, and regularization theory.citations_number: 718Citation: A Tutorial on Support Vector Machines for Pattern Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=478e7ec22867ba234e18c5e17d8cd98bBenchmarking Least Squares Support Vector Machine Classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f3624e73e75bd085cbfb1a2473fc8604An overview of statistical learning theory http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f766c0cfb7bb144841f0a88a094d94d2An introduction to kernel-based learning algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a93bdd507c6e45b33431b1a1cc836d30An introduction to kernel-based learning algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3628ed8c921b841657be18b1b1552fc8New support vector algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3d26c7b685bc5ac5e82b6f03992a6b74Support vector machines for classification and regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8d91624686d4111b0a46388a0030b1a6Weighted least squares support vector machines : Robustness and sparse approximation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=11011e20458091dc9772f3c786e8b7abReferences: Interpolation of Scattered Data: Distance Matrices and Conditionally Positive Definite Functions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cbe7a3d56172a69fc61a0ed85a6ceb87Smoothing noisy data with spline functions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cd987a3407eb91232f9efef4554c1523Approximation Theory and Spline Functions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=81cb067c3a255450a7bfe61c5cef7fdaBasis pursuit http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fbdb2087342bbb3fbdfa8e3b044946faFunctional Analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=605e1b1c60c7bf27601a345f5871764dFrom regularization operators to support vector kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=eb01aca4a73e80b353e14799d80df963Extensions of a theory of networks for approximation and learning: outliers and negative examples http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fc9b34202b7953ebd253cbae5f0ec641Development of low entropy coding in a recurrent network http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9c7eaa0864eb530f0318e21a7d0d2051Regularization methods for linear inverse problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4ba5180b5610819f8fdceaed91e0cf50analysis of linear integral equations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5ecbc079968ed7268776f57d1509203cExtensions of a Theory of Networks for Approximation and Learning: Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=afac4427e7a500eb16a4e141ce5f1bdaIll-posed problems. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0cf083407827e7edc0517b4e237f138cRegularization theory and neural networks architectures http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f9daf14a800fbc37416dfa4172864ae6Regularization methods for linear inverse problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=53cf1991c51f18af200e0c85f5a1ce0c
