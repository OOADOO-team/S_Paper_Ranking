name: Face recognition by support vector machinesurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2427763_Face_Recognition_by_Support_Vector_Machinespublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Guodong Guo,S.Z. Li,Kapluk Chan,abstract: Support vector machines (SVM) have been recently proposed as a new technique for pattern recognition. SVM with a binary tree recognition strategy are used to tackle the face recognition problem. We illustrate the potential of SVM on the Cambridge ORL face database, which consists of 400 images of 40 individuals, containing quite a high degree of variability in expression, pose, and facial details. We also present the recognition experiment on a larger face database of 1079 images of 137 individuals. We compare the SVM-based recognition with the standard eigenface approach using the nearest center classification (NCC) criterion.citations_number: 741Citation: Handbook of face recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5d4517b662a90fcad6d79c197d899839Face recognition using kernel principal component analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3157b4d351f5564b3a554843d16c9898Face recognition: component-based versus global approaches http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0d11a70fb9717617316f134e22ce2169Recent advances in visual and infrared face recognition\u2014a review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8a4e303559ac42e072b039a956800d10Face recognition using kernel principal component analysis and genetic algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6f4cf1e41a8699839294b9c02cd31ac0Face recognition using kernel principal component analysis and genetic algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e3019093e23b90a1f5b152da5acbc45eTotal variation models for variable lighting face recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=388d9a80b772ac357ce0276a4b761459Image-Based Human Age Estimation by Manifold Learning and Locally Adjusted Robust Regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bb0ae26c4c2fd92d5254629d8f4e3bc5Illumination Normalization for Robust Face Recognition Against Varying Lighting Conditions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0cb47ced542440176b7bcfd6b58f03daFacial feature detection and face recognition from 2D and 3D images http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8658fdcfcf10d21c4115291dafd9fa27References: Training Support Vector Machines: an Application to Face Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a695bfc73b605e2cc76745541a626a3cFace recognition: Features versus templates http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=38d97098e561c1ef5a01caafcd45e196Visual learning and recognition of 3-d objects from appearance http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=64c71f5a7d56f64ea6ec919a434a1ec4Face recognition: a convolutional neural-network approach http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=372a09df45043576ad82fdcce955d5acParameterisation of a stochastic model for human face identification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=504e8efdf9cf1f57b775cfd6e920bf73Face recognition: the problem of compensating for changes in illumination direction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1326333d24859959f9d766efdfacc1e6Face recognition: the problem of compensating for changes in illumination direction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=10e6eab0a73d46bc601e53663a056edeFace Recognition: The Problem of Compensating for Changes in Illumination Direction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d309c41043044846a761011200b966b6Automatic recognition and analysis of human faces and facial expressions: a survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=55b6b82a4799b7e71f3cdc6156dd49f5Connectionist models of face processing: A survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ce42a7e10cfa4f978965828a295fa4e5Identification of human faces http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=47de0acb4ce9106f7e7d200798073656Feature-based face recognition using mixture-distance http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d2d8f4c2959a83d1be12d866d5c450cbVisual learning and recognition of 3-d objects from appearance http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=de1a2d21dedba0471c525dbf471131bbVisual learning and recognition of 3-D objects from appearance http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fce2c96b94cd3c3c0085671ffe059f3a
