name: Toward an Optimal SVM Classification System for Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Imagesurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/3204286_Toward_an_Optimal_SVM_Classification_System_for_Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Imagespublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Bazi, Y., Melgani, F.,abstract: Recent remote sensing literature has shown that support vector  machine (SVM) methods generally outperform traditional statistical and  neural methods in classification problems involving hyperspectral  images. However, there are still open issues that, if suitably  addressed, could allow further improvement of their performances in  terms of classification accuracy. Two especially critical issues are: 1)  the determination of the most appropriate feature subspace where to  carry out the classification task and 2) model selection. In this paper, these two issues are addressed through a classification system that optimizes the SVM classifier accuracy for this kind of imagery. This system is based on a genetic optimization framework formulated in such a  way as to detect the best discriminative features without requiring the  a priori setting of their number by the user and to estimate the best  SVM parameters (i.e., regularization and kernel parameters) in a completely automatic way. For these purposes, it exploits fitness criteria intrinsically related to the generalization capabilities of SVM  classifiers. In particular, two criteria are explored, namely: 1) the  simple support vector count and 2) the radius margin bound. The effectiveness of the proposed classification system in general and of these two criteria in particular is assessed both by simulated and real experiments. In addition, a comparison with classification approaches based on three different feature selection methods is reported, i.e., the steepest ascent (SA) algorithm and two other methods explicitly developed for SVM classifiers, namely: 1) the recursive feature elimination technique and 2) the radius margin bound minimization methodcitations_number: 341Citation: Spectral and Spatial
