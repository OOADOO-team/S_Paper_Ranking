ICONIP \"02. - Radius margin bounds for support vector machines with the RBF kernelurl: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1198190public_in: IEEEXploreauthors: Kai-Min Chung, , Wei-Chun Kao, , Sun, T.,abstract: An important approach for efficient support vector machine (SVM) model selection is to use differentiable bounds of the leave-one-out (LOO) error. Past efforts focused on finding tight bounds of LOO. However, their practical viability is still not very satisfactory. Duan et al. (2002) has been shown that radius margin bound gives good prediction for L2-SVM. In this paper, through the analyses why this bound performs well for L2-SVM, we show that finding a bound whose minima are in a region with small LOO values may be more important than its tightness. Based on this principle we propose modified radius margin bounds for L1-SVM where the original bound is only applicable to the hard-margin case. Our modification for L1-SVM achieves comparable performance to L2-SVM.citations_number: 259Citation: Classification of hyperspectral remote sensing images with support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=302d09839efa8d5f2df65ef43aa5f82cCombining SVMs with Various Feature Selection Strategies http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e44829df3b3ef501e17aadf45a67cb22Combining SVMs with Various Feature Selection Strategies http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=26cd4b9d7bc2cf3ffd3b29b9f1cc9966Evolutionary tuning of multiple SVM parameters http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=541024ac674c7e403c7ae869001394f2Radius Margin Bounds for Support Vector Machines with the RBF Kernel http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c537a22fc564d71603e0d82b0f3d08bcFusion of Support Vector Machines for Classification of Multisensor Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=36b4a11030198890423462890e0bb2d5Leave-One-Out Bounds for Support Vector Regression Model Selection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1ed52accef3e5d55048d967e020c0b8aA novel LS-SVMs hyper-parameter selection based on particle swarm optimization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b8bacea3e7eff6e46565a0b22468c81cModel selection for the LS-SVM.
