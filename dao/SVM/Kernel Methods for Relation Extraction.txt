name: Kernel Methods for Relation Extractionurl: http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1983941public_in: AMSauthors: Zelenko, Dmitry,Aone, Chinatsu,Richardella, Anthony,abstract: We present an application of kernel methods to extracting relations from unstructured natural language sources. We introduce kernels defined over shallow parse representations of text, and design efficient algorithms for computing the kernels. We use the devised kernels in conjunction with Support Vector Machine and Voted Perceptron learning algorithms for the task of extracting person-affiliation and organization-location relations from text. We experimentally evaluate the proposed methods and compare them with feature-based learning algorithms, with promising results.citations_number: 989Citation: Dependency tree kernels for relation extraction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fb9f538a8093e8c07b9b838883574ac9A shortest path dependency kernel for relation extraction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e73f025d3b7dd23be75f6c2f9416eef7\u7f51\u7edc\u5927\u6570\u636e:\u73b0\u72b6\u4e0e\u5c55\u671b http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e9b24eb5b599e87692337a941638a6bfDiscovering relations among named entities from large corpora http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=228b2f32c32874cad75c49fabcf4f2a3Combining lexical, syntactic, and semantic features with maximum entropy models for extracting relations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=64c8afd19cc919f1a7ea62aa2b47c6d0Subsequence kernels for relation extraction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0e9ba2e25eacb82da26111460feedd45Efficient Convolution Kernels for Dependency and Constituent Syntactic Trees http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4919f57abe4e24660b0bf174141a4436Efficient convolution kernels for dependency and constituent syntactic trees http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8e6d640f51a8e3c633cd3e33cb012eedSimilarity of semantic relations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f11c2fe2b259fcf07ddffd6c54be88aeReferences: Text classification using string kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3ee4341d15fead1aae34072af1b0ce17Maximum Entropy Markov Models for Information Extraction and Segmentation. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e766a72327f78ab85d0cb4beeb3e341fMaximum Entropy Markov Models for Information Extraction and Segmentation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=45e9fdfe3ffb96341ea79465ae9470e3Parsing By Chunks http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5938569bfdd136820838ae1f4579ced0New ranking algorithms for parsing and tagging: kernels over discrete structures, and the voted perceptron http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fda866abba4ddec704bf45b7c72e95dcInformation Extraction with HMM Structures Learned by Stochastic Optimization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8887149acc29c7bdb37ad004b6850f14A generalized kernel approach to dissimilarity-based classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=232102e9cb2461f82e029c2689cd7429REES: A Large-Scale Relation and Event Extraction System http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=14e5212c750ce93d0e83f0bd3e9122b5Classification on Pairwise Proximity Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fee695b3f4478778137fa4171c0b2504
