name: Learning to Classify Text Using Support Vector Machines / Methods, Theory and Algorithmsurl: http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4615-0907-3public_in: Springerauthors: Joachims Thorsten,abstract: Based on ideas from Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Learning To Classify Text Using Support Vector Machines presents a new approach to generating text classifiers from examples. The approach combines high performance and efficiency with theoretical understanding and improved robustness. In particular, it is highly effective without greedy heuristic components. The SVM approach is computationally efficient in training and classification, and it comes with a learning theory that can guide real-world applications. Learning To Classify Text Using Support Vector Machines gives a complete and detailed description of the SVM approach to learning text classifiers, including training algorithms, transductive text classification, efficient performance estimation, and a statistical learning model of text classification. In addition, it includes an overview of the field of text classification, making it self-contained even for newcomers to the field. This book gives a concise introduction to SVMs for pattern recognition, and it includes a detailed description of how to formulate text-classification tasks for machine learning.citations_number: 468Citation: Boosting for transfer learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5c5876267006d039f27f01ae5148904bConvexity, Classification, and Risk Bounds http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f4ba280ba324e58e379a1fbc0f0907e6YAGO: A Large Ontology from Wikipedia and WordNet http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=acdc0e6fad9428b6d0d21ebe4fb71742Adaptive name matching in information integration http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=04b0d8d54781d6ce7877756e5a78d02eThe Immune Epitope Database 2.0 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cdff23a7a6c1ecf65b70958307280589An application of support vector machines in bankruptcy prediction model. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c0695080324b5fe2fc514207e5aa8aa1Kernel Methods in Machine Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4ba954f8b0d51f1363e9fcf5709312e5The Nested Chinese Restaurant Process and Bayesian Nonparametric Inference of Topic Hierarchies http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bde57be0991d97361e94efac04e9f9e7A survey of kernels for structured data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fd82b70ba08d7d39fabfa5d253eeeb1bExtracting Opinions, Opinion Holders, and Topics Expressed in Online News Media Text http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7b925cf0fac7db255e59f41c036b07b3References:
