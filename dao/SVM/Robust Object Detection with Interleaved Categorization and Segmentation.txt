name: Robust Object Detection with Interleaved Categorization and Segmentationurl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-007-0095-3public_in: Springerauthors: Bastian Leibe, Ale? Leonardis, Bernt Schiele,abstract: This paper presents a novel method for detecting and localizing objects of a visual category in cluttered real-world scenes. Our approach considers object categorization and figure-ground segmentation as two interleaved processes that closely collaborate towards a common goal. As shown in our work, the tight coupling between those two processes allows them to benefit from each other and improve the combined performance. The core part of our approach is a highly flexible learned representation for object shape that can combine the information observed on different training examples in a probabilistic extension of the generalized Hough transform. The resulting approach can detect categorical objects in novel images and automatically infer a probabilistic segmentation from the recognition result. This segmentation is then in turn used to again improve recognition by allowing the system to focus its efforts on object pixels and to discard misleading influences from the background. Moreover, the information from where in the image a hypothesis draws its support is employed in an MDL based hypothesis verification stage to resolve ambiguities between overlapping hypotheses and factor out the effects of partial occlusion.citations_number: 1117Citation: Pedestrian Detection: An Evaluation of the State of the Art http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=484460277f448fe1390d74c58c5af83eSurvey of pedestrian detection for advanced driver assistance systems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ed57919592d324ef1239185a0ced9c79Pedestrian detection: A benchmark http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d7ebe4b6fa38b3e2a37f74428c808f35Class-Specific Hough Forests for Object Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=47b4ed5242295f085dd2bb83ab4566fdPedestrian detection: A benchmark http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b9f1ee3045a30f8cd5203d3073eb9e53CPMC: Automatic Object Segmentation Using Constrained Parametric Min-Cuts http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c8999cadb24afdd3b774e212e0b6d2a8Robust tracking-by-detection using a detector confidence particle filter http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3ac873216317c7fc70a6a5a170b189f6References: Edge detection and ridge detection with automatic scale selection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=47362b3b98dab68a8cbdb894d450ad41Contour and Texture Analysis for Image Segmentation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bf3080b169d235e8f57dd539d63ad246Mean-shift blob tracking through scale space http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9c86d4f35b7a8329fb7ce7ee26ad2ae9Saliency, Scale and Image Description http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=32f23bbfe9a5cd65cfbec363ed62b568One-shot learning of object categories http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=708447607ce7198ed8dddc5ae8480565Learning to detect objects in images via a sparse, part-based representation. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bf6dd22f660e76d95e4f97f9f63b190cPedestrian Detection in Crowded Scenes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dbe31c03dfb3cae1bc43a00baf60e5a8Matching Widely Separated Views Based on Affine Invariant Regions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=944b1dd3939641bb16c41bb3670cc398Human Detection Based on a Probabilistic Assembly of Robust Part Detectors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7dfcaa274e3a8a9e6e1ce964e46f5a25Human Detection Based on a Probabilistic Assembly of Robust Part Detectors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=05236a72815aca3c36ceecbd02f82b97Human Detection Based on a Probabilistic Assembly of Robust Part Detectors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e60137fc4f4690d95329592f19d29052The Variable Bandwidth Mean Shift and Data-Driven Scale Selection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=95e602dac8d1cbbb2a86485f87f911d5Sharing Features: Efficient Boosting Procedures for Multiclass Object Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=745b455dd1efbe9b93130fe437cec3d2A Trainable System for Object Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5dd7a851a794aeb35d9ee26858421ed4A Bayesian Approach to Unsupervised One-Shot Learning of Object Categories. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0261bc4d5f80548dfe6a579a09734579Example-Based Object Detection in Images by Components http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e14bb0377a95332fa15788582148a480Detection of Multiple, Partially Occluded Humans in a Single Image by Bayesian Combination of Edgelet Part Detectors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e8f7b15d95d3112c705ecc6097a7aeacVisual features of intermediate complexity and their use in classification. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f2f6a4e036a99f9ded07521f6d477688Convolutional Face Finder: A Neural Architecture for Fast and Robust Face Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=395ad7de14a355c7559897893dffa412
