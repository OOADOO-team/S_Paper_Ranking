S., Cristianini, N., Duffy, N.,abstract: Motivation: DNA microarray experiments generating thousands of gene expression measurements, are being used to gather information from tissue and cell samples regarding gene expression differences that will be useful in diagnosing disease. We have developed a new method to analyse this kind of data using support vector machines (SVMs). This analysis consists of both classification of the tissue samples, and an exploration of the data for mis-labeled or questionable tissue results. Results: We demonstrate the method in detail on samples consisting of ovarian cancer tissues, normal ovarian tissues, and other normal tissues. The dataset consists of expression experiment results for 97 802 cDNAs for each tissue. As a result of computational analysis, a tissue sample is discovered and confirmed to be wrongly labeled Upon correction of this mistake and the removal of an outlier perfect classification of tissues is achieved, but not with high confidence. We identify and analyse a subset of genes from the ovarian dataset whose expression is highly differentiated between the types of tissues. To show robustness of the SVM method, two previously published datasets from other types of tissues or cells are analysed The results are comparable to those previously obtained. We show that other machine learning methods also perform comparably to the SVM on many of those datasets.citations_number: 2946Citation: Gene Selection for Cancer Classification using Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8854f0c7f668ca96b4ea79e580d025b0Feature selection based on mutual information criteria of max-dependency, max-relevance, and min-redundancy http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8b30e86867c54cac845e887de686f7a7New prognostic factors for breast cancer recurrence. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=01a98a54705628b85a0c311fe5293f89Support vector machine classification and validation of cancer tissue samples using microarray expression data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=774a5c2cf4fbedef1633f5e78b7d1564Missing value estimation methods for DNA microarrays http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=12a9b4c32dad36709d9f87690968e1c7Gene-expression profiles in hereditary breast cancer http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dfd284951dd23d20fbe7cdbcebda7177Gene-Expression Profiles in Hereditary Breast Cancer http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f92acdfe76530c042f9476c3e58d703bMulticlass cancer diagnosis using tumor gene expression signatures http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4594b9544ed34fea49d867dff9c48b45Gene Expression in Fixed Tissues and Outcome in Hepatocellular Carcinoma http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=be475c4c2024fa97d604fe01f217a2c9Dicer is essential for mouse development. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e780b5564899968214dbfb79554e0593References: Broad patterns of gene expression revealed by clustering analysis of tumor and normal colon tissues probed by oligonucleotide arrays http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=97d26274713fe6a145c108b42fa58280Support vector machine classification and validation of cancer tissue samples using microarray expression data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=774a5c2cf4fbedef1633f5e78b7d1564The Transcriptional Program of Sporulation in Budding Yeast http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=05c19d05d94bf5f2abaf644b3bff7c5cLarge-Scale Temporal Gene Expression Mapping of Central Nervous System Development http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=19945af4d5553aaecb9332111bbe4d82Cellular gene expression altered by human cytomegalovirus: global monitoring with oligonucleotide arrays http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=430799907b55dc6f39806380b55c12f0Monitoring gene expression profile changes in ovarian carcinomas using cDNA microarray. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=73010fdd66a31720116e619481da7074Engineering support vector machine kernels that recognize translation initiation sites http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4cc0a0fd57057fdf83002e211eebf902Comparative hybridization of an array of 21 500 ovarian cDNAs for the discovery of genes overexpressed in ovarian carcinomas http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6b5c71bdc6d84627477f500c87dc4d03Periventricular white matter injury in the premature infant is followed by reduced cerebral cortical gray matter volume at term http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1bb93406f6c1708dac0631dc17bc04a9
