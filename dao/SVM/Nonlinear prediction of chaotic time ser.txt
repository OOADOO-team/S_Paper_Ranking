Mukherjee,F. Girosi,E. Osuna,abstract: A novel method for regression has been recently proposed by Vapnik et al. (1995, 1996). The technique, called support vector machine (SVM), is very well founded from the mathematical point of view and seems to provide a new insight in function approximation. We implemented the SVM and tested it on a database of chaotic time series previously used to compare the performances of different approximation techniques, including polynomial and rational approximation, local polynomial techniques, radial basis functions, and neural networks. The SVM performs better than the other approaches. We also study, for a particular time series, the variability in performance with respect to the few free parameters of SVM.citations_number: 801Citation: A Tutorial on Support Vector Machines for Pattern Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=478e7ec22867ba234e18c5e17d8cd98bSupport vector machines for classification and regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8d91624686d4111b0a46388a0030b1a6Financial time series forecasting using support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fc97df9af80b0c44817924fc8da48160Application of support vector machines in financial time series forecasting http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d152a735f92bbe228d4c134cbff3c1c3An application of support vector machines in bankruptcy prediction model. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c0695080324b5fe2fc514207e5aa8aa1Support vector machines for wind speed prediction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=81dc5e8631740aa0317f8a4244a46918Efficient SVM Regression Training with SMO http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f67c7988b140574bf8f8694fc5c1f786\u77ed\u671f\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=99a10517dd73f03d384c88e437159411Support vector machines experts for time series forecasting http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=088f4901837ec691a147817e5df9d2f6Time Series Prediction Using Support Vector Machines: A Survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a79927ed51624eac3b0064835efa47c6References: Nonlinear prediction of chaotic time series http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=316c90c8c19831c43bf0e7ea259775dfSupport vector machines: Training and applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a9510c9b33d7c27d96fcdfed403be7caMultiple-valued stationary state and its instability of the transmitted light by a ring cavity system http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ac50e3dd9c2c8c4875e4659dd1121ad4Large-Scale Linearly Constrained Optimization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7c04dd2ba6a78f00d73b71f2d92d5e29Chaotic attractor learning and how to deal with nonlinear singularities http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a0f57e6c8bc85354bf038694b2879635Support vector machines: training and applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cc4a4a4faf642ee18309ee3011de35d5
