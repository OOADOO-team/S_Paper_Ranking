name: Ranking with Large Margin Principle: Two Approachesurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2940775_Ranking_with_Large_Margin_Principle_Twopublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Amnon Shashua,Anat Levin,abstract: ABSTRACT  We discuss the problem of ranking k instances with the use of a &quot;large margin&quot; principle. We introduce two main approaches: the first is the &quot;fixed margin&quot; policy in which the margin of the closest neighboring classes is being maximized --- which turns out to be a direct generalization of SVM to ranking learning. The second approach allows for k Gamma 1 different margins where the sum of margins is maximized. This approach is shown to reduce to -SVM when the number of classes k = 2. Both approaches are optimal in size of 2l where l is the total number of training examples. Experiments performed on visual classification and &quot;collaborative filtering&quot; show that both approaches outperform existing ordinal regression algorithms applied for ranking and multi-class SVM applied to general multi-class classification.citations_number: 338Citation: Learning to Rank for Information Retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7bdcd1c22c180ddab2ebcb982715a2b1Gaussian Processes for Ordinal Regression. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3a3262c6a4ca8247207afe45fed52357New approaches to support vector ordinal regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c3dceebddf3988bd54122b99a06b8409Learning to Rank for Information Retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ae58d5cd87158d6acad3c982e3dd7ddcOrdinal Regression by Extended Binary Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8e2a75f5e9652ffdd63dade1fee4a32cOrdinal hyperplanes ranker with cost sensitivities for age estimation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4fae05437e05325c9e5b89508acd0205Ordinal hyperplanes ranker with cost sensitivities for age estimation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7145da8ba431867c4b4ce4037a2d588dOrdinal Regression by Extended Binary Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c431a4307ec8b8c274da83f58d0967dbSupport Vector Ordinal Regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=577001e0f6f826a0db69b729947161b0Learning to Classify Ordinal Data: The Data Replication Method http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=98e657bd5f5449931c08252a50d3d06bReferences: On the algorithmic implementation of multiclass kernel-based vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b47acd19b1fd48eebecffeb19e54274fLearning to order things http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4f1e4790fbde85be31c4899a72d26a98Training nu-support vector classifiers: theory and algorithms. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=90fee87b0e49c3cc69450c19dc671860A Reformulation of Linear Models http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7e5480699f768553c680fb7a494fb38bLearning to order things http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f60294f86c83801825afc26896e98c1eOn the algorithmic implementation of multiclass kernel-based vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a08f2b97b6d527cb618c83e7c67aeddb
