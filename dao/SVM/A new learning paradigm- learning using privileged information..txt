name: A new learning paradigm: learning using privileged information.url: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608009001130public_in: Elsevierauthors: Vapnik, Vladimir,Vashist, Akshay,abstract: In the Afterword to the second edition of the book “Estimation of Dependences Based on Empirical Data” by V. Vapnik, an advanced learning paradigm called Learning Using Hidden Information (LUHI) was introduced. This Afterword also suggested an extension of the SVM method (the so called SVM γ+ method) to implement algorithms which address the LUHI paradigm ( Vapnik, 1982–2006, Sections 2.4.2 and 2.5.3 of the Afterword). See also ( Vapnik, Vashist, &amp; Pavlovitch, 2008, 2009) for further development of the algorithms. In contrast to the existing machine learning paradigm where a teacher does not play an important role, the advanced learning paradigm considers some elements of human teaching. In the new paradigm along with examples, a teacher can provide students with hidden information that exists in explanations, comments, comparisons, and so on. This paper discusses details of the new paradigm 1 1 In this article we changed the terminology. We will call this paradigm Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) (instead of LUHI) since the word privilege better reflects the core idea of the new paradigm. and corresponding algorithms, introduces some new algorithms, considers several specific forms of privileged information, demonstrates superiority of the new learning paradigm over the classical learning paradigm when solving practical problems, and discusses general questions related to the new ideas.citations_number: 272Citation: Man vs. computer: benchmarking machine learning algorithms for traffic sign recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=16adc7a464bd7bb75a705daad9efa95fThe German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark: A multi-class classification competition. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1c4c0381d89092b3285b6fc1b777cf7cRecent advances on support vector machines research http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=98b185fc2923874069d364c0f58adb79Cross-Domain Image Retrieval with a Dual Attribute-Aware Ranking Network http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=79e2663bfd04e9ddf2b09e8dd840f483Learning to Rank Using Privileged Information http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5ff81107b8a8cea3e054140f75fce9a2Learning with Intelligent Teacher: Similarity Control and Knowledge Transfer http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=28c91ede28ec2fcec582d2b7bbfb3205Learning using privileged information: similarity control and knowledge transfer http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f14945bbaac9b68be5717e48c7d9521fTowards the Science of Security and Privacy in Machine Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6ab6277e3282a63e32256796d55d5004Randomized Nonlinear Component Analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0923d515f5286c3ee23b62271b498ff9End-to-End Learning of Driving Models from Large-Scale Video Datasets http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5d6184c4787356a79f8dfc8af6cc9bd4References: Nonlinear prediction of chaotic time series using support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=83aef60916b197abb16ffb6f0fd5cbf6Optimal aggregation of classifiers in statistical learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6dede1231200cc931a83d44d5bfc32b0Combining pairwise sequence similarity and support vector machines for detecting remote protein evolutionary and structural relationships. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2015a4ed1f0cf5dd676fc916bf428ea8Combining pairwise sequence similarity and support vector machines for remote protein homology detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=19e7d9debeb2e2fd8b494bd2a1bfb030Smooth Discrimination Analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f0b457eb8678e9a661b19e7c7a813da3MAMMOTH (matching molecular models obtained from theory): an automated method for model comparison. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d36738aabf25ade29cb453dcb4e5654fSupport Vector Machines are Universally Consistent http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bd6a84a0271bc187a762eb709e63b59cSupport vector machines are universally consistent http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f42974a14125241ede6e1cec76894017Learning using hidden information (Learning with teacher) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9d2e8ca57dbe2a9faf382c36640ee54fNonlinear Prediction of Chaotic Time Series using a Support Vector Machine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=11c222840c972873f30a4d64cd95e3bfLearning using hidden information (Learning with teacher) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6c50fa9095ea4cd471d0b568077054a6
