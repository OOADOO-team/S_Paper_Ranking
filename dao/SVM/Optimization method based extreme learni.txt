name: Optimization method based extreme learning machine for classificationurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231210002225public_in: Elsevierauthors: Huang, GuangBin,Ding, Xiaojian,Zhou, Hongming,abstract: Extreme learning machine (ELM) as an emergent technology has shown its good performance in regression applications as well as in large dataset (and/or multi-label) classification applications The ELM theory shows that the hidden nodes of the generalized single-hidden layer feedforward networks (SLFNs) which need not be neuron alike can be randomly generated and the universal approximation capability of such SLFNs can be guaranteed This paper further studies ELM for classification in the aspect of the standard optimization method and extends ELM to a specific type of generalized SLFNs support vector network. This paper shows that (1) under the ELM learning framework SVM s maximal margin property and the minimal norm of weights theory of feedforward neural networks are actually consistent (2) from the standard optimization method point of view ELM for classification and SVM are equivalent but ELM has less optimization constraints due to its special separability feature (3) as analyzed in theory and further verified by the simulation results ELM for classification tends to achieve better generalization performance than traditional SVM ELM for classification is less sensitive to user specified parameters and can be implemented easily (C) 2010 Elsevier B V All rights reservedcitations_number: 529Citation: Extreme learning machine for regression and multiclass classification. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6edb04901d6ffc75c8c36aae6e3bb14dExtreme learning machines: a survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4bf48d06b7c37584d833c5720587a7e3An Insight into Extreme Learning Machines: Random Neurons, Random Features and Kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9af5045ee2bc1400669cea54d987ea82Trends in extreme learning machines: A review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cf0fdc3ffb3933252d93c0c0954a73eaA study on effectiveness of extreme learning machine \u2606 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=29c13943865892975571bb3f3c5fd7d3Weighted extreme learning machine for imbalance learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=988df8f4f9fbc675769043fd89157beaFace recognition based on extreme learning machine. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a0536e349858e9046deb4fc3f91eb494GPU-accelerated and parallelized ELM ensembles for large-scale regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f81d1e36231954a821500a05aa1bcb3aExtreme Learning Machines [Trends & Controversies] http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c9f3528586ecefd88d2369c3fd67b879Probabilistic Forecasting of Wind Power Generation Using Extreme Learning Machine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6a99fef0e6d7a651b1d5f03dc7b51139References: Multicategory proximal support vector machine classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1d15c90b43eac9e303d102de41ba3642A fast and accurate online sequential learning algorithm for feedforward networks. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=36382df502190f6fdec30922d46a0bffConvex incremental extreme learning machine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d4a390d491b061b0471a8dc930995f80Enhanced random search based incremental extreme learning machine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6d196301253e0659f7bc7f3548f02d0bError Minimized Extreme Learning Machine With Growth of Hidden Nodes and Incremental Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fe97d2ce33532f3ee4a51b47031c2c1bFully complex extreme learning machine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=92ed700283850f55d6d5bc5e5d77f770Can threshold networks be trained directly? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3cf76531eb562cb23015d92a3090e606Online sequential fuzzy extreme learning machine for function approximation and classification problems. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a6231f12f39653dac8d5615a47852a4bExtreme Support Vector Machine Classifier http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=eee373b913b43eeb3c277548d19bd837Extreme Support Vector Machine Classifier http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=eb6817029dc0665e40a773d5d48cdfa4NEUROSVM: an architecture to reduce the effect of the choice of kernel on the performance of svm http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=86d303168562f7441daf06d09e6eaad8NEUROSVM: An Architecture to Reduce the Effect of the Choice of Kernel on the Performance of SVM http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=08262b11a4c057ae83a412a18d3bae6f
