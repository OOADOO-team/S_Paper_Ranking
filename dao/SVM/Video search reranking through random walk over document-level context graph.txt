name: Video search reranking through random walk over document-level context graphurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221572156_Video_search_reranking_through_random_walk_over_document-level_context_graph?ev=auth_pubpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Hsu, Winston H.,Kennedy, Lyndon S.,Chang, Shih-Fu,abstract: Multimedia search over distributed sources often result in recurrent images or videos which are manifested beyond the textual modality. To exploit such contextual patterns and keep the simplicity of the keyword-based search, we propose novel reranking methods to leverage the recurrent patterns to improve the initial text search results. The approach, context reranking, is formulated as a random walk problem along the context graph, where video stories are nodes and the edges between them are weighted by multimodal contextual similarities. The random walk is biased with the preference towards stories with higher initial text search scores - a principled way to consider both initial text search results and their implicit contextual relationships. When evaluated on TRECVID 2005 video benchmark, the proposed approach can improve retrieval on the average up to 32% relative to the baseline text search method in terms of story-level Mean Average Precision. In the people-related queries, which usually have recurrent coverage across news sources, we can have up to 40% relative improvement. Most of all, the proposed method does not require any additional input from users (e.g., example images), or complex search models for special queries (e.g., named person search).citations_number: 308Citation: VisualRank: Applying PageRank to Large-Scale Image Search http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5a1061bdaa4f0116a3cbfc5b44aad3fcTag ranking http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8fba837efd5df5a40c55fa4e41a885bcDescriptive visual words and visual phrases for image applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4c3d0c12635a7d7a9bc13b1457e89cdaDescriptive visual words and visual phrases for image applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=16e7251cf1eb487f640dabb52455936cVisual-textual joint relevance learning for tag-based social image search. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e9a6bf2f1bf44e37b2ba01295c449c29Bayesian video search reranking http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4b633015022dadf9735095cf08acbca3Real-Time Near-Duplicate Elimination for Web Video Search With Content and Context http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5e27cdc35c0511874ffa109c0ead656cMultimodal graph-based reranking for web image search. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2b87aafb38594f8f414b6e8400bc7bc6Active Reranking for Web Image Search http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5d42670726291cbcf68e93e2d8bee71aClick Prediction for Web Image Reranking Using Multimodal Sparse Coding http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7adedf0e193caae9ad5a4ef1d996bb17References: On spectral clustering: analysis and an algorithm http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0e383376364787f29c5d94fd3482a4e2On spectral clustering: Analysis and an algorithm http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d2c78d1a864735ae833fb92dba11f8dbCombining labeled and unlabeled data with co-training http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=66c89609b3906ec9efa43b1cd8aaddb9Transductive Inference for Text Classification using Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6301f4fbd109ade166381062fa93cf55Extrapolation Methods for Accelerating PageRank Computations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6b678b41799ffee67958e7aa150407eaDocument clustering using word clusters via the information bottleneck method http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0b4690b3504cb284443bfb2ced422ec2Learning approaches for Detecting and Tracking News Events http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e1839d2d2c6638496fbdd2f08206867aA Visual Category Filter for Google Images http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ad637cabb3ae3c8cde9d29d571bfb73fA Visual Category Filter for Google Images http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=31c93e99510e49ff592ab49d48dd8a27Video search reranking via information bottleneck principle http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ecad7eeb87525bc1115df86d38d2ce2fThe Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=046995d02bbe12d8ad56a073f490cd22A Survey of Eigenvector Methods for Web Information Retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a5a181cb14e2091378c0d2d11e830780Multimedia search with pseudo-relevance feedback http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=298723472c09ea2d6ec56bdaadf4ee14Multimedia Search with Pseudo-relevance Feedback http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=036995aed06c59edcb7649e3d77e2c38Detecting image near-duplicate by stochastic attributed relational graph matching with learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=acf570d6d28f5cdecfa47361cc5637d3Learning the semantics of multimedia queries and concepts from a small number of examples http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7540fad12709773d32246d1b7e3376a3A Comparison of Score, Rank and Probability-Based Fusion Methods for Video Shot Retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e597a6eb5ad6aaf0b6b21b72c8032837GCap: Graph-based Automatic Image Captioning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=55ade00ec124432b266b1b2c078701dfSuccessful approaches in the TREC video retrieval evaluations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f0a2acafc0ca30dbc0b1185d589cb52f
