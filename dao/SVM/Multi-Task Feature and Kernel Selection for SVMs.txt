name: Multi-Task Feature and Kernel Selection for SVMsurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2949553_Multi-Task_Feature_and_Kernel_Selection_for_SVMspublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Tony Jebara,abstract: We compute a common feature selection or kernel selection configuration for multiple support vector machines (SVMs) trained on different yet inter-related datasets. The method is advantageous when multiple classification tasks and differently labeled datasets exist over a common input space. Different datasets can mutually reinforce a common choice of representation or relevant features for their various classifiers. We derive a multi-task representation learning approach using the maximum entropy discrimination formalism. The resulting convex algorithms maintain the global solution properties of support vector machines. However, in addition to multiple SVM classification/regression parameters they also jointly estimate an optimal subset of features or optimal combination of kernels. Experiments are shown on standardized datasets.citations_number: 248Citation: A Survey on Transfer Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ec1ecbd0509de6c42d304a6902afc203Convex multi-task feature learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fa588c638cb097cb7e3a69c58e0c8137Multi-Task Feature Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a627485fb3267b2e42069c7c6fef5551Multi-Task Feature Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fc7cf4db1326d81885e2b9b897cbfaf6Learning Multiple Tasks with Kernel Methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=319ec4037378907990bcac2ae4ce10feJoint covariate selection and joint subspace selection for multiple classification problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b806fa458cbf387aa7e7bf79fd49e39aTransfer learning for collaborative filtering via a rating-matrix generative model http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c36a69856f4082a603ba7c611fa432b6Learning non-linear combinations of kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=78ba2819d1f8a60938095a23792bc01dTransfer learning for image classification with sparse prototype representations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8cc193085b9db2612b46674a4672ecaaTransfer learning for image classification with sparse prototype representations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=393422fd7750998f5c516c927cc14577References: Multitask Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=de41cd0414414ba209ac9cbf89bbb57dA model of inductive bias learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1cd608c58fc39583fe2f39bdc6a95944Model selection for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=be58ae1ecacd3bfb41ba70722d98b85fExploiting Task Relatedness for Multiple Task Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c88cc731454afc4ff87692bc6d560e22Maximum Entropy Discrimination. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3485373654d130b0bc5bc2df3ff10a14Maximum Entropy Discrimination http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2651c08e40cebd5ea7558c35b4afc308Learning internal representations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a7e846d5905b76599227eb0cea69b001Learning Internal Representations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9518279e90d9be32c9a6a07798762363Exploiting task relatedness for multiple task learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ecb74b572b43864e47cfa95c841a5de9Exploiting Task Relatedness for Multiple Task Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=640a1191a9e6c1d81222c94cd59b0ee3
