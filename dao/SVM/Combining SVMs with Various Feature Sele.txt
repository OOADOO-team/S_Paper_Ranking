name: Combining SVMs with Various Feature Selection Strategiesurl: http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%252F978-3-540-35488-8_13public_in: Springerauthors: Yi-Wei Chen,Chih-Jen Lin,abstract: This article investigates the performance of combining support vector machines (SVM) and various feature selection strategies. Some of them are filter-type approaches: general feature selection methods independent of SVM, and some are wrapper-type methods: modifications of SVM which can be used to select features. We apply these strategies while participating to the NIPS 2003 Feature Selection Challenge and rank third as a group.citations_number: 687Citation: Combining SVMs with Various Feature Selection Strategies http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=26cd4b9d7bc2cf3ffd3b29b9f1cc9966Combining SVMs with Various Feature Selection Strategies http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e44829df3b3ef501e17aadf45a67cb22Learning to discover social circles in ego networks http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=28b0cce5667535431685ed378a2e1489Credit scoring with a data mining approach based on support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=694fc607d8ce43867cd99e5332fe1f15Credit scoring with a data mining approach based on support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=862573bf8f69bf2243869a11c641d71aSupport vector machines combined with feature selection for breast cancer diagnosis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e84e9eb32c95cf34637123d545509efcDe novo SVM classification of precursor microRNAs from genomic pseudo hairpins using global and intrinsic folding measures. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=53edee060d8cf773dfca3ca3235cd010EEG-based emotion recognition in music listening. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0138d2a6cf833534bc56f5aaa2a27fb2Viewpoint Invariant Texture Description Using Fractal Analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d3eba0cc64ccd61552a8b97da5bcd97References: Transductive Inference for Text Classification using Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6301f4fbd109ade166381062fa93cf55Choosing Multiple Parameters for Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f0b5df497d87b2ce12d5881a7113a946Transductive Inference for Text Classification using Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=36360d9d15b6c46485f4986a4b05df50Irrelevant Features and the Subset Selection Problem http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d990c4ae3c6b9b94057f2429daf63309Asymptotic behaviors of support vector machines with gaussian kernel http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=abca416fb71ce1fe858c348548891de5Probability Estimates for Multi-class Classification by Pairwise Coupling http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=31ae585176690c114d87de06d8e26528Random Forests http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=93ad1228381429f80b23922825db0809Random Forests http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=498d2ec77751813bc97aaa7e2e728718Improving Text Classification by Shrinkage in a Hierarchy of Classes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=71e3cd7c6e15bcfad537eda82573672e
