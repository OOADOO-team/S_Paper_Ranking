name: Incorporating Prior Knowledge with Weighted Margin Support Vector Machinesurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221653619_Incorporating_prior_knowledge_with_weighted_margin_support_vector_machinespublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Wu, Xiaoyun,Srihari, Rohini,abstract: Like many purely data-driven machine learning methods, Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are learned exclusively from the evidence presented in the training dataset; thus a larger training dataset is required for better performance. In some applications, there might be human knowledge available that, in principle, could compensate for the lack of data. In this paper, we propose a simple generalization of SVM: Weighted Margin SVM (WMSVMs) that permits the incorporation of prior knowledge. We show that Sequential Minimal Optimization can be used in training WMSVM. We discuss the issues of incorporating prior knowledge using this rather general formulation. The experimental results show that the proposed methods of incorporating prior knowledge is effective.citations_number: 191Citation: Cross-domain video concept detection using adaptive svms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fbe47b1d77c787341db30420e47f006eSentiment analysis of blogs by combining lexical knowledge with text classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=33cfa5cb959b7fab1cdb36a82f0f58e4KBA: kernel boundary alignment considering imbalanced data distribution http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=915fdcaeb6ee055ddbe74e960e442b8dHuman reidentification with transferred metric learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=90c1c05d839698f86a2be7c29d5587a4Learning from labeled features using generalized expectation criteria http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bcb902cea0a52eff9b9d235967ac6e80Human Reidentification with Transferred Metric Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5e1e715fbf8b8d4fa7a35c73d6e00a27Efficient Bayesian Hierarchical User Modeling for Recommendation Systems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5a7dae8adbec560592fab8cc9d6824b1Document-Word Co-regularization for Semi-supervised Sentiment Analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7a78301ba533f5e1dec2d96552439750A non-negative matrix tri-factorization approach to sentiment classification with lexical prior knowledge http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dd8c9b9e2c62f1c63fb10520b642ed1eIncorporating Prior Knowledge in Support Vector Machines for Classification: a Review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=36753841d6f1725cd82950c0ef04e8fcReferences: Statistical Learning Theory and Induction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=162e23423300e341cf421decb85b9304Transductive Inference for Text Classification using Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=36360d9d15b6c46485f4986a4b05df50Advances in kernel methods: support vector learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1fa9ced6ad4a5147d6c809af68e686e2Support vector machine active learning with applications to text classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=60db55eac5b1321cc15ca663f6112d3cLearning to Classify Text Using Support Vector Machines: Methods, Theory and Algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ecbf55ede4ee85f19d9b4d17f840258aOHSUMED: An Interactive Retrieval Evaluation and New Large Test Collection for Research http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7c88811074c067064b8dbb566b3dc011Semi-supervised support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9130a5c6a977596ee68f31e7fd20b93eOHSUMED: An Interactive Retrieval Evaluation and New Large Test Collection for Research http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dfb5c301fe4c69fb669c09a027e1ce97Statistical Learning Theory http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bb4aa463429a586bfa8111c94cb63a78Using a generalized instance set for automatic text categorization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2e506c42742d04a2e05588c0af3ee001Incorporating Prior Knowledge into Boosting http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=85fee7286d7d84f6a3f58e870faf294fRobustness of regularized linear classification methods in text categorization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ed674f1d97fb9294a43250ef36ae4654Support vector machine active learning with applications to text classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=996d032804abe463d492a2b2052a3cd7Using a generalized instance set for automatic text categorization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4aab54a46c805c557a456b5f1e601e31
