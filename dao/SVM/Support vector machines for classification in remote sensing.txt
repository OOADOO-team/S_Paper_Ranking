M.,abstract: Support vector machines (SVM) represent a promising development in machine learning research that is not widely used within the remote sensing community. This paper reports the results of two experiments in which multi-class SVMs are compared with maximum likelihood (ML) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods in terms of classification accuracy. The two land cover classification experiments use multispectral (Landsat-7 ETM+) and hyperspectral (DAIS) data, respectively, for test areas in eastern England and central Spain. Our results show that the SVM achieves a higher level of classification accuracy than either the ML or the ANN classifier, and that the SVM can be used with small training datasets and high-dimensional data.citations_number: 474Citation: Toward an Optimal SVM Classification System for Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Images http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ce9beb4f8f498b42264dfe524eccfbaeThe use of small training sets containing mixed pixels for accurate hard image classification : Training on mixed spectral responses for classification by ... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1122588db97f55f983f2f7de60c292f9Fusion of Support Vector Machines for Classification of Multisensor Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=36b4a11030198890423462890e0bb2d5Change detection from remotely sensed images: From pixel-based to object-based approaches http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d99d96c2dea47c2363131d7e59bec8d8A kernel functions analysis for support vector machines for land cover classification. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e5824b20b6a1067d165e083b139bd772Cross-border Comparison of Post-socialist Farmland Abandonment in the Carpathians http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fdd0d62711905f2a6c671ee093158e5fThe application of artificial neural networks to the analysis of remotely sensed data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b3f0379dc7da40534866f191e852a86Use of a dark object concept and support vector machines to automate forest cover change analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e6e8b6334630267ae4d2f00387e2b020\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u786e\u5b9a http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9402e32c6bcc8a1ac74d9026ab0840b4Cross-border Comparison of Post-socialist Farmland Abandonment in the Carpathians http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6d59e5ed49ca83f5ebc7e455b2667e94References: Neural Network Approaches Versus Statistical Methods in Classification of Multisource Remote Sensing Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=11c59f5a6a61a0ca73c17643932bc845Neural Network Approaches Versus Statistical Methods in Classification of Multisource Remote Sensing Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d3e600877195d1c45dd2bb70bf78e19bClassification using ASTER data and SVM algorithms; : The case study of Beer Sheva, Israel http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4f93b53be334ad54da287e21f6186e10Using prior knowledge in artificial neural network classification with a minimal training set http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a763b5a44a897d1ea4e7b8bbc9767244An evaluation of fuzzy and texture-based classification approaches for mapping regenerating tropical forest classes from Landsat-TM data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0d78803d3ae8278a8c332d6c6fc26493The effect of training set size and composition on artificial neural network classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d03883f44f60773f648fd608f8ca9efc
