A very successful means of inferring the function of a previously unannotated protein is via sequence similarity with one or more proteins whose functions are already known. Currently, one of the most powerful such homology detection methods is the SVM-Fisher method of Jaakkola, Diekhans and Haussler (ISMB 2000). This method combines a generative, profile hidden Markov model (HMM) with a discriminative classification algorithm known as a support vector machine (SVM). The current work presents an alternative method for SVM-based protein classification. The method, SVM-pairwise, uses a pairwise sequence similarity algorithm such as Smith-Waterman in place of the HMM in the SVM-Fisher method. The resulting algorithm, when tested on its ability to recognize previously unseen families from the SCOP database, yields significantly better remote protein homology detection than SVM-Fisher, profile HMMs and PSI-BLAST.citations_number: 484Citation: A statistical framework for genomic data fusion http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ddd98a451fb406eee2eb4eb43897ebe7Combining pairwise sequence similarity and support vector machines for detecting remote protein evolutionary and structural relationships. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2015a4ed1f0cf5dd676fc916bf428ea8Combining pairwise sequence similarity and support vector machines for remote protein homology detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=19e7d9debeb2e2fd8b494bd2a1bfb030Support Vector Machine Applications in Computational Biology http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c3337a61ebf14aa6d33017e767f5754bSimilarity-based classification: concepts and algorithms. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=405ecd7f529febf09653405d179a45bfA new learning paradigm: learning using privileged information. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ad1cdc087a87b04d6445d4101520fe26Remote homology detection: a motif based approach http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8454fa37c47192e604a6980c4491599bFast String Kernels using Inexact Matching for Protein Sequences http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5b1192e86bf2daac0b9b70e04b7d2184Fast String Kernels using Inexact Matching for Protein Sequences http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5eaed429c42b8dd8124fb4e8a037f948Sequence comparison and protein structure prediction. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2987bb734f170624c5492a1f945c82aeReferences: On Comparing Classifiers: Pitfalls to Avoid and a Recommended Approach http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=681ceeb69d21609bad04f27d9c41a880Sequence comparisons using multiple sequences detect three times as many remote homologues as pairwise methods. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=751632f00dcab27995585f04b4553803Hidden Markov models of biological primary sequence information. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=de25349552289c429d3c55a841707215Use of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate sequence matching http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d4c2f03df5f80ed81d1745c61601c7a1Using the Fisher kernel method to detect remote protein homologies. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9c286bb2091a086d7a3666244c35d867Combining pairwise sequence similarity and support vector machines for remote protein homology detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=19e7d9debeb2e2fd8b494bd2a1bfb030Classifying proteins by family using the product of correlated p-values http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b35bed2061bd84be9799584461caccb2
