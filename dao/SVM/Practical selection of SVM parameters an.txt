name: Practical selection of SVM parameters and noise estimation for SVM regressionurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608003001692public_in: Elsevierauthors: Vladimir Cherkassky, Yunqian Ma,abstract: We investigate practical selection of hyper-parameters for support  vector machines (SVM) regression (that is, epsiv-insensitive zone and regularization parameter C). The proposed methodology advocates analytic  parameter selection directly from the training data, rather than  re-sampling approaches commonly used in SVM applications. In particular,  we describe a new analytical prescription for setting the value of  insensitive zone epsiv, as a function of training sample size. Good  generalization performance of the proposed parameter selection is  demonstrated empirically using several low- and high-dimensional  regression problems. Further, we point out the importance of Vapnik&#039;s  epsiv-insensitive loss for regression problems with finite samples. To  this end, we compare generalization performance of SVM regression (using  proposed selection of epsiv-values) with regression using  `least-modulus&#039; loss (epsiv=0) and standard squared loss. These  comparisons indicate superior generalization performance of SVM  regression under sparse sample settings, for various types of additive  noisecitations_number: 1751Citation: YAGO: A Large Ontology from Wikipedia and WordNet http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=acdc0e6fad9428b6d0d21ebe4fb71742Applying support vector machines to predict building energy consumption in tropical region http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=af1cb9392b61f3ad06f7b651c0486122Support vector regression for real-time flood stage forecasting http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3a7bd3bfc19831d5797446e8c294f71aFinancial time series forecasting using independent component analysis and support vector regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=12b8366ebe7b307109643d19e68f4a20Support vector echo-state machine for chaotic time-series prediction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2f577e986a738cf84b15653caa659cb9Classification of Hyperspectral Images With Regularized Linear Discriminant Analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d4e1df493ceb04b39f72b02afe021614Cellular automata for simulating land use changes based on support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=98bb2b1a7cec42ef134dd505e59b17ccRiver stage prediction based on a distributed support vector regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7315d5fb4b486e556d064a86d128893fElectric load forecasting by support vector model http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c99ef5bbbd18ed36b301e183f2541a85Soft-sensor development for fed-batch bioreactors using support vector regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=393e74ae463857542ed418cdc1a465cfReferences: Robust Estimation of a Location Parameter http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=617c4daa1fe7b2e94c794a802f696e83Using support vector machines for time series prediction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=688e843d9d87a60afb268429f2ec94a7Model selection for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=be58ae1ecacd3bfb41ba70722d98b85fModel complexity control for regression using VC generalization bounds http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f28183419350a82d45f8585b87f7baefSupport vector machines for dynamic reconstruction of a chaotic system http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5212ff136e2b4a1e477c3208ee992732Asymptotically Optimal Choice of \u03b5-Loss for Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=15bb91ba08ce479d9864a0eb6ac17d02Linear Dependency between \u03b5 and the Input Noise in \u03b5 -Support Vector Regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cf3b4ea1a76e4f7142b7c2f5d146466bLinear Dependency between epsilon and the Input Noise in epsilon-Support Vector Regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5d75b6660a1e529a0537a4a44ae2ee8aLinear dependency between \/spl epsi\/ and the input noise in \/spl epsi\/-support vector regression. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cfb17973904cf6293d692d0a40efce04Support Vector Regression with Automatic Accuracy Control http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1cdabdd75518938595bcfdfda49b8b0f
