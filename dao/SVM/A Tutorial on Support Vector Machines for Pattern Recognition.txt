name: A Tutorial on Support Vector Machines for Pattern Recognitionurl: http://www.worldscientific.com/servlet/linkout?suffix=S0218126618501396BIB036&amp;dbid=16&amp;doi=10.1142%2FS0218126618501396&amp;key=10.1023%2FA%3A1009715923555public_in: World Scientific Publishingauthors: Christopher J.C. Burges,abstract: The article starts with an overview of the concepts of VC  dimension and structural risk minimization. We then describe linear  support vector machines (SVMs) for separable and non separable data,  working through a non trivial example in detail. We describe a  mechanical analogy, and discuss when SVM solutions are unique and when  they are global. We describe how support vector training can be  practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping  technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear  in the data. We show how support vector machines can have very large  (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for  homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While  very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization  performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows  that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are  several arguments which support the observed high accuracy of SVMs,  which we review. Results of some experiments which were inspired by  these arguments are also presented. We give numerous examples and proofs  of most of the key theoremscitations_number: 2Citation: LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b1552ffd60e8a942090f6dfadd26687A Comparative Study on Feature Selection in Text Categorization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=05231674e8cb124ed6030a989df55ecaStatistical pattern recognition: a review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=079121efa11798514b67b66d00de4289\u5173\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9ff9531735d1c3074a95810c88dfd009Feature selection based on mutual information criteria of max-dependency, max-relevance, and min-redundancy http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8b30e86867c54cac845e887de686f7a7Cortical surface-based analysis.
