name: Variational Relevance Vector Machinesurl: http://www.oalib.com/paper/4058149public_in: OALibauthors: Christopher M. Bishop,Michael Tipping,abstract: The Support Vector Machine (SVM) of Vapnik (1998) has become widely established as one of the leading approaches to pattern recognition and machine learning. It expresses predictions in terms of a linear combination of kernel functions centred on a subset of the training data, known as support vectors. Despite its widespread success, the SVM suffers from some important limitations, one of the most significant being that it makes point predictions rather than generating predictive distributions. Recently Tipping (1999) has formulated the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), a probabilistic model whose functional form is equivalent to the SVM. It achieves comparable recognition accuracy to the SVM, yet provides a full predictive distribution, and also requires substantially fewer kernel functions. The original treatment of the RVM relied on the use of type II maximum likelihood (the `evidence framework&#039;) to provide point estimates of the hyperparameters which govern model sparsity. In this paper we show how the RVM can be formulated and solved within a completely Bayesian paradigm through the use of variational inference, thereby giving a posterior distribution over both parameters and hyperparameters. We demonstrate the practicality and performance of the variational RVM using both synthetic and real world examples.citations_number: 461Citation: Sparse bayesian learning and the relevance vector machine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4c52e3d4a44c728814da7eaa0fb5edd2Bayesian Compressive Sensing http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c297b71c6c0b1710a32a5bc4a2aef964Sparse Bayesian learning for basis selection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8dce2c6b25e9358d9d3058c4f151ffe13D Human Pose from Silhouettes by Relevance Vector Regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c2d12b53998263820a7f54e76bac0163Adaptive Sparseness for Supervised Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5ab37f6bfb1a93e4f2f32093da54b9b6Content-based audio classification and retrieval by support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=865e39692404703a067717be57b901ffExploiting Structure in Wavelet-Based Bayesian Compressive Sensing http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4bf0662573b0d31975f339612fdecac0Multitask Compressive Sensing. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c7ee2d12c97fba581d2e00869ac2719bMultitask Compressive Sensing http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4a947f3d90450d76a24a6c6d6c875834Spatiotemporal salient points for visual recognition of human actions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a9210c933e61448d861dfaf809fa5ec5References: Bayesian Interpolation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=606e2896a29638dda5fccf27c589f38fBayesian Interpolation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8ab1fc1a09de9e29e8769e8b13e95bccThe Evidence Framework applied to Classification Networks http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=eaaf5a0db4d35ce4ab6ae28a1dbb7c29Input Space Versus Feature Space in Kernel-Based Methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=edd0273817621c00de6cfe949e4f9cccNEURAL NETWORKS AND RELATED METHODS FOR CLASSIFICATION.
