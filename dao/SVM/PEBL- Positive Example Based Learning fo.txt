name: PEBL: Positive Example Based Learning for Web Page Classification Using SVMurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2560536_PEBL_Positive_Example_Based_Learning_for_Web_Page_Classification_Using_SVMpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Hwanjo Yu,Jiawei Han,abstract: Web page classification is one of the essential techniques for Web mining. Specifically, classifying Web pages of a user-interesting class is the first step of mining interesting information from the Web. However, constructing a classifier for an interesting class requires laborious pre-processing such as collecting positive and negative training examples. For instance, in order to construct a &quot;homepage&quot; classifier, one needs to collect a sample of homepages (positive examples) and a sample of non-homepages (negative examples). In particular, collecting negative training examples requires arduous work and special caution to avoid biasing them. We introduce in this paper the Positive Example Based Learning (PEBL) framework for Web page classification which eliminates the need for manually collecting negative training examples in pre-processing. We present an algorithm called Mapping-Convergence (M-C) that achieves classification accuracy (with positive and unlabeled data) as high as that of traditional SVM (with positive and negative data). Our experiments show that when the M-C algorithm uses the same amount of positive examples as that of traditional SVM, the M-C algorithm performs as well as traditional SVM.citations_number: 382Citation: Discriminative Methods for Multi-labeled Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d8c745d78d284f3b3513cc83c357395Discriminative Methods for Multi-labeled Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=426f7e4165a67803afb8add4692a3657Discriminative Methods for Multi-labeled Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a1b8978f79e1a93bc6407071ab5d0305One-Class Collaborative Filtering http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4697d6a5d6788061a08b6b6e59f6fb68Building Text Classifiers Using Positive and Unlabeled Examples http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=943afd9a5e2d7a3869596a01da2066a0One-Class Collaborative Filtering http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=84f974fe38814cf445afeef7e4bdd4f6Learning to classify texts using positive and unlabeled data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a09ac4740b81a2c30850c3326d4f1f17Classifying Large Data Sets Using SVM with Hierarchical Clusters http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a930b63bbd945bc5126f59e39e4f281eClassifying large data sets using SVMs with hierarchical clusters http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=812175d11e4b48f1b47f64b3b984bc4dWeb Data Mining: Exploring Hyperlinks, Contents, and Usage Data (Data-Centric Systems and Applications) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=22aba747a959cba794fc6d9dddc3c136References: Hierarchical classification of Web content http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5d96111f3993831df517d51d5818512cOne-class svms for document classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=76da3be5d93ddc76f0a5654477e721f9Learning to Extract Symbolic Knowledge from the World Wide Web http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fd553b8c508edcedd5821ee4851c8c48Uniform Object Generation for Optimizing One--class Classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a4a4694da8d4dac94038e015ecac7f37Improving Category Specific Web Search by Learning Query Modifications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=44d3ff16ada96458329af176527e9022PAC Learning from Positive Statistical Queries http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=82f92e8b71424f0c445e6efb79fbd8f7Learning From Positive and Unlabeled Examples http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6b3db1a811e9ba9fafa801e4d1e0fdb8A practical hypertext catergorization method using links and incrementally available class information http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=26b430e7e2716fa9f8d0016296947ddbA practical hypertext catergorization method using links and incrementally available class information http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=186d954b21faaf22fb5920d52451c74aA classifier for semi-structured documents http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ce5018a14bc6752423c4141982fce127DEADLINER:building a new niche search engine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c44d038194da9eae0022e11fff5e3f08Multiclass Classification with Pairwise Coupled Neural Networks or Support Vector Machines. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1951d62db34c9c833d76c2339b7a4569
