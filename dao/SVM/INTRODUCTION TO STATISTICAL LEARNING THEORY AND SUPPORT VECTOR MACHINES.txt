name: INTRODUCTION TO STATISTICAL LEARNING THEORY AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINESurl: http://en.cnki.com.cn/article_en/cjfdtotal-moto200001005.htmpublic_in: 知网authors: Zhang, Xue Gong,abstract: Data based machine learning covers a wide range of topics from pattern recognition to function regression and density estimation. Most of the existing methods are based on traditional statistics, which provides conclusion only for the situation where sample size is tending to infinity. So they may not work in practical cases of limited samples. Statistical Learning Theory or SLT is a small sample statistics by Vapnik et al., which concerns mainly the statistic principles when samples are limited, especially the properties of learning procedure in such cases. SLT provides us a new framework for the general learning problem, and a novel powerful learning method called Support Vector Machine or SVM, which can solve small sample learning problems better. It is believed that the study of SLT and SVM is becoming a new hot area in the field of machine learning. This review introduces the basic ideas of SLT and SVM, their major characteristics and some current research trends.citations_number: 1949Citation: An Improved SVM: NN-SVM http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=216066ad518c69cad2a7a1ca3c23c2ae\u57fa\u4e8eEMD\u80fd\u91cf\u71b5\u548c\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u7684\u9f7f\u8f6e\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=34f9cf87557f447a74634d3bfa9dbcd3\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5e94\u7528 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b551c7e08fc0935fe45e833047a5bf27Pre-extracting Support Vectors for Support Vector Machine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fbd79c3fa8a53370158b43aca5b87b77Research on Extreme Learning of Neural Networks http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3e41c56953f1bc48ffbe4076e62d3848\u57fa\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u7684\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cb5755432b08d6248394ebe06c35805aPredictive control algorithm based on least squares support (vector) machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4a4154a2a85141da5c3798d16c39a7b7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u7684\u5929\u7136\u6c14\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=198c73e77af32b938b543457f5ac6168\u5173\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u56de\u5f52\u673a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ca874d3fc5c0b6c1dbb153eb597563f9\u57fa\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u7684Internet\u6d41\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7814\u7a76 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cd625cdde33a058d111877042f84484dReferences: Interactive support vector machine learning algorithm and its application http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8f9f2b775eb87a4d4f8f3e8b51a75d6dThe Overfitting in Automatic Classification and Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4c22bbf99910c8adc5697fd8616a0a29
