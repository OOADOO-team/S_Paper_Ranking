name: Support vector machines for wind speed predictionurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960148103003860public_in: Elsevierauthors: M.A. Mohandes, T.O. Halawani, S. Rehman,abstract: This paper introduces support vector machines (SVM), the latest  neural network algorithm, to wind speed prediction and compares their performance with the multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks. Mean daily wind speed data from Madina city, Saudi Arabia, is used for building and testing both models. Results indicate that SVM compare favorably with the MLP model based on the root mean square errors between the actual and the predicted data. These results are confirmed for a system with order 1 to system with order 11citations_number: 525Citation: A review on the forecasting of wind speed and generated power http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ea0d9fcad9a7886886b6c7485471da07Current methods and advances in forecasting of wind power generation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c85efa8b3f8bf2812e91ccdc64c6ba75Financial time series forecasting using independent component analysis and support vector regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=12b8366ebe7b307109643d19e68f4a20Role of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization in apoptosis and cancer http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=78b6e17372dfd5b9977ac2e8c7752dfbThe prediction and diagnosis of wind turbine faults http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5c4a5ff0c23b4ea6fcf9ca725626b68eApplication of artificial neural networks for the wind speed prediction of target station using reference stations data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c6889ee20f2a21d7bc528df034bd4cdeMulti-step forecasting for wind speed using a modified EMD-based artificial neural network model http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=14ec5b6229e1ccb7de2544d73bc0e325Software reliability forecasting by support vector machines with simulated annealing algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fac537d90403425f40e2f2d67767c0b9System reliability forecasting by support vector machines with genetic algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0d311afc246c88bfcaa6d6ba88034592A strategic review of electricity systems models http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e722336a199c932173093b35cb93cafaReferences: Statistical Learning Theory and Induction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=162e23423300e341cf421decb85b9304Advances in kernel methods: support vector learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1fa9ced6ad4a5147d6c809af68e686e2An Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-based Learning Methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0c522e3cf4b0b69b8c1a26197f04a20cSVMTorch: support vector machines for large-scale regression problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d73d941ff03709380fd407d1b644d45SVMTorch: support vector machines for large-scale regression problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=60a9069d18c3f025967de4fee051828ePredicting time series with support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a230caf5724a1417dd85e057481774efPredicting time series with support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e9bad9f7b1e95f02b76e6ac8369f9f04Predicting Time Series with Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4ab3e63a006db2b4e0186b394d3d87d7Nonlinear prediction of chaotic time series using support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=83aef60916b197abb16ffb6f0fd5cbf6Estimation of global solar radiation using artificial neural networks http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6acc41b1162097278732aff0f441164bStatistical characteristics of wind in Saudi Arabia http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=10519210f21c54088520ef30353e53e4Correlation between hourly diffuse and global radiation for Dhahran, Saudi Arabia http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1a98a18e3d9ad6e1a36e3855a2ef7b30Nonlinear Prediction of Chaotic Time Series using a Support Vector Machine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=11c222840c972873f30a4d64cd95e3bf
