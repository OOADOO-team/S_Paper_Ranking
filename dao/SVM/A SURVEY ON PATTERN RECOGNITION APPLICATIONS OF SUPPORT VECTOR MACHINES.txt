name: A SURVEY ON PATTERN RECOGNITION APPLICATIONS OF SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINESurl: http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218001403002460public_in: World Scientific Publishingauthors: BYUN, HYERAN, LEE, SEONG-WHAN,abstract: In this paper, we present a survey on pattern recognition applications of Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Since SVMs show good generalization performance on many real-life data and the approach is properly motivated theoretically, it has been applied to wide range of applications. This paper describes a brief introduction of SVMs and summarizes its various pattern recognition applications.citations_number: 309Citation: \u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u53ca\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u7efc\u8ff0 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1065caeb3e95de004a00ca1379fc72aaAutomatic recognition of handwritten numerical strings: a recognition and verification strategy http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6c1e4f996dc28cca1bb94ebfabd22a4eEdit distance-based kernel functions for structural pattern classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d8516715a0379828fdd98c590a1ae84bA hybrid machine learning approach to network anomaly detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=95d8a536845f02375159fdea1397004dReal-Time Detection of Driver Cognitive Distraction Using Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e787cda4fb68429df8e9a7048708e282Keystroke dynamics identity verification\u2014its problems and practical solutions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=83ae56d1179d8885b1fa4b19a7973058Support Vector Machines and Application Research Overview http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=33a014f97e42868460e099f7f871e396Heartbeat Time Series Classification With Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=eedbacb3bd4c0b6976e0daf1c91416a8Predicting the risk of metabolic acidosis for newborns based on fetal heart rate signal classification using support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=75ee019e998c9e87e25ea24370cfad23Support vector machines versus multi-layer perceptrons for efficient off-line signature recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3c316c297357443db7993b159200fd21References: Support-vector networks http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f7d42c769039379ae049e30d257ec2eaA Tutorial on Support Vector Machines for Pattern Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=478e7ec22867ba234e18c5e17d8cd98bA training algorithm for optimal margin classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fcee14409ac8673a3c41b818a716878dText categorization with Support Vector Machines: Learning with many relevant features http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=58aa6cfa340e6ae6809c5deadd07d88eText categorization with Support Vector Machines: Learning with many relevant features http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2f3ab6001f10fb375bcdb6d859e23e5eA comparison of methods for multiclass support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b9cd4bfb4d07c34b416308b85ebf97a1A Comparison of Methods for Multiclass Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1be26f8d6e2f32156cda4d10c6807e66Training Support Vector Machines: an Application to Face Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a695bfc73b605e2cc76745541a626a3cAdvances in kernel methods: support vector learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1fa9ced6ad4a5147d6c809af68e686e2
