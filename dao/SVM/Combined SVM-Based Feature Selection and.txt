name: Combined SVM-Based Feature Selection and Classificationurl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-005-1505-9public_in: Springerauthors: Julia Neumann, Christoph Schn?rr, Gabriele Steidl,abstract: Feature selection is an important combinatorial optimisation problem in the context of supervised pattern classification. This paper presents four novel continuous feature selection approaches directly minimising the classifier performance. In particular, we include linear and nonlinear Support Vector Machine classifiers. The key ideas of our approaches are additional regularisation and embedded nonlinear feature selection. To solve our optimisation problems, we apply difference of convex functions programming which is a general framework for non-convex continuous optimisation. Experiments with artificial data and with various real-world problems including organ classification in computed tomography scans demonstrate that our methods accomplish the desired feature selection and classification performance simultaneously.citations_number: 207Citation: Neighborhood rough set based heterogeneous feature subset selection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3c886ec257e03965121b627e8cb8d20eHybrid attribute reduction based on a novel fuzzy-rough model and information granulation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=16fe16fb7db06bc71ac50b6f71fb0ba7Neighborhood classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d41e0174fe9926033aae8ed9293b913cA survey on feature selection methods \u2606 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5146a8281e705cb233c8422617322b61Feature selection with dynamic mutual information http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=99a781111cc821e9d6065417174678c3Supervised feature selection via dependence estimation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=242a76384212644363657aae4a6b125bParameter determination of support vector machine and feature selection using simulated annealing approach http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d2e4b9a053fca7768e7099275abd2d99Mixed feature selection based on granulation and approximation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9df963a23154411c317cb3eb7029d30cA rough set approach to feature selection based on ant colony optimization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c37b7b8f8ef494effe83dd20ba62e119On the convergence of the concave-convex procedure http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dc490accc2b1b40c7fe6881dad20a679References: Multiple kernel learning, conic duality, and the SMO algorithm http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4a6f07782f2ad1ab4be13d6e9a444232On kernel-target alignment http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5937c42ebbf7c1055b90c34debe30101The lasso method for variable selection in the Cox model. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3c7348a950597586da5c2f9e18e582caFeature Selection via Concave Minimization and Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=13389db677d1742a3b3b17fe62458122Use of the zero-norm with linear models and kernel methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a05f14c12659172c73daaa45e52eb3b9Engineering support vector machine kernels that recognize translation initiation sites http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4cc0a0fd57057fdf83002e211eebf902Deleted DOI - Crossref http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d17e2fe6a2d8c9d6825a9832eb168b0Robust Truss Topology Design via Semidefinite Programming http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1cd1982e3e0f0eca1040937009bfadd8SpliceMachine: predicting splice sites from high-dimensional local context representations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=209966d4a968f663e7f4a27ff4573339Learning with Distance Substitution Kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c67424cedadbd51da389c7186b2beaa8Feature selection for splice site prediction: A new method using EDA-based feature ranking http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=978d99f12eadab808a1136e4e98b2d53Learning with Distance Substitution Kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8a996f4d0e45f721a486fe1e3c7b9cc4Feature selection for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7445f66c75f6ac0de12983fbfddad894Generalizations of Markov model to characterize biological sequences http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=335776e2f5d74aadaeb162146a5ebf6fTrends in mathematical optimization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ce8a76bd2801270d117d33bb7a1d389fSVM-Based Feature Selection by Direct Objective Minimisation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fd9d148b18514cde5be108ea698b79b9Minimum-support solutions of polyhedral concave programs http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3cdab9aee30690d8193f922510d1aeb4Duality in D.C.
