name: Pegasos: primal estimated sub-gradient solver for SVM.url: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221344925_Pegasos_Primal_estimated_sub-GrAdient_sOlver_for_SVMpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: ShalevShwartz, Shai,Singer, Yoram,Srebro, Nathan,abstract: We describe and analyze a simple and effective stochastic sub-gradient descent algorithm for solving the optimization problem cast by Support Vector Machines (SVM). We prove that the number of iterations required to obtain a solution of accuracy [FORMULA] is [FORMULA], where each iteration operates on a single training example. In contrast, previous analyses of stochastic gradient descent methods for SVMs require [FORMULA] iterations. As in previously devised SVM solvers, the number of iterations also scales linearly with 1/λ, where λ is the regularization parameter of SVM. For a linear kernel, the total run-time of our method is [FORMULA], where d is a bound on the number of non-zero features in each example. Since the run-time does not depend directly on the size of the training set, the resulting algorithm is especially suited for learning from large datasets. Our approach also extends to non-linear kernels while working solely on the primal objective function, though in this case the runtime does depend linearly on the training set size. Our algorithm is particularly well suited for large text classification problems, where we demonstrate an order-of-magnitude speedup over previous SVM learning methods.citations_number: 1462Citation: LIBLINEAR: A Library for Large Linear Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a3fe9da36ff3056948f663b10aeae1acPegasos: Primal Estimated sub-GrAdient SOlver for SVM http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d19c179365153d7743cf5aab07472191Pedestrian Detection: An Evaluation of the State of the Art http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=484460277f448fe1390d74c58c5af83eCutting-plane training of structural SVMs http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=89d31a15aa09826faae2706f7088bfc2The tradeoffs of large scale learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=923dd5d3e54e94c69912e8409b63599bEfficient additive kernels via explicit feature maps. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3f37e97734b9526cbdb34d5496f310d5Efficient projections onto the l 1 -ball for learning in high dimensions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e7d60a6eabef3a83633e8350fe52b5a3Efficient projections onto the l 1 -ball for learning in high dimensions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e86a71eeb16e0f84143f01e36fac9b48Efficient additive kernels via explicit feature maps http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e22696ba35f2d233657cc6ced56a1d5bReferences: Making large-scale support vector machine learning practical http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d173cb9f98a78ed94ab46461e4ac0185Training linear SVMs in linear time http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6564feba203c56d36db06dd733612ce0Introduction to Stochastic Search and Optimization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=90106d3a01389c84c4514ec982164910Pegasos: Primal Estimated sub-GrAdient SOlver for SVM http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d19c179365153d7743cf5aab07472191Online Passive-Aggressive Algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f2c4fcdca6f325b1b1b3d5a199afbdbbStochastic Approximation Algorithms and Applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2ecbf81d73cdfdb9bb7afad72767c7c9Some results on Tchebycheffian spline functions \u2606 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cd4e41d253d917b9b36f8d96d208f1d8Learning with Kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a9e264443461d780494802f48c7bc1b0Parallel Optimization: Theory, Algorithms and Applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b373b21041efbdcf7d5aa0d6990490c2
