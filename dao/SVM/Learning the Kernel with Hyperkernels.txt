name: Learning the Kernel with Hyperkernelsurl: http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2249848public_in: AMSauthors: Cheng Soon Ong,Alexander J Smola,Robert C Williamson,abstract: This paper addresses the problem of choosing a kernel suitable for estimation with a support vector machine, hence further automating machine learning. This goal is achieved by defining a reproducing kernel Hilbert space on the space of kernels itself. Such a formulation leads to a statistical estimation problem similar to the problem of minimizing a regularized risk functional. We state the equivalent representer theorem for the choice of kernels and present a semidefinite programming formulation of the resulting optimization problem. Several recipes for constructing hyperkernels are provided, as well as the details of common machine learning problems. Experimental results for classification, regression and novelty detection on UCI data show the feasibility of our approach.citations_number: 415Citation: Multiple Kernel Learning Algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4b5eaf8b81682322ba25e45541ed81f2Learning The Discriminative Power-Invariance Trade-Off http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5fd8f3ed11917d0576b16217f09991baMore generality in efficient multiple kernel learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cbe32091bea9a331978316569adc6e65Multiclass Multiple Kernel Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6011d25a35a17adb6e3e1d2a086182a8MultiK-MHKS: A Novel Multiple Kernel Learning Algorithm http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=067c94f1c2306cb0a37de8026287be2eLearning non-linear combinations of kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=78ba2819d1f8a60938095a23792bc01dOptimal kernel selection in Kernel Fisher discriminant analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b661639230af34adfe80e294882115e8Learning Interpretable SVMs for Biological Sequence Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=364e8e2242172b3028c71fc38c4c8436References: Choosing Multiple Parameters for Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f0b5df497d87b2ce12d5881a7113a946New support vector algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3d26c7b685bc5ac5e82b6f03992a6b74Learning the Kernel Matrix with Semi-Definite Programming. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=599f68acd7b267d7a31fe23b626a4cdeKernel independent component analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8e507fb79163beebde4c84e4b44e33e0Soft Margins for AdaBoost http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f03e203be204e3b7fb6db9460cbdc4aeLagrangian support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e88e123fe313e65f395e3ad2ae9de157The connection between regularization operators and support vector kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=05ab68cdab9948b35c1761eaf7244a91Efficient svm training using low-rank kernel representations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d92ff1759aa8ea3d9712202c6fced6b2Evaluation of simple performance measures for tuning SVM hyperparameters http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=25bd6e328a18bd7b53a129a9afd68e86Bayesian classification with Gaussian processes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6216cff26744ecb3de9aee8257025f06The support vector machine under test http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4643842cf13780d2af64e07a893f22b9Generalization performance of support vector machines and other pattern classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=483c1dbe910babed6effd86c2b8828dbThe particle swarm optimization algorithm in size and shape optimization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=be7e9ab69729ca69d332db831f1fe11eConditions for Positive and Nonnegative Definiteness in Terms of Pseudoinverses http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1fcfc37881f31054cb481231621a02fcA Swarm Metaphor for Multiobjective Design Optimization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fff289358b89139755c69529d0d00124Knowledge processing with Fuzzy Cognitive Maps http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9afcb45c25d8cd9bbecee5b0812abaf7Asymptotic Analysis of Penalized Likelihood and Related Estimators http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=18c2219a5e8d9c7e8c19110b39d5493aFeature Selection for Structure\u2212Activity Correlation Using Binary Particle Swarms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=561676542e95e3f6e503fcc2b75baef9Active Hebbian learning algorithm to train fuzzy cognitive maps http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=490572e4fc818695cec3cfc57d5b2256The em algorithm for kernel matrix completion with auxiliary data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=438683b3e263223a0d5be08053bdd5c6Kernel independent component analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cc0ab889972dc5861b6bb50e78f272a5Kernel independent component analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cb32f1255d4d6d81a4ce06724247277cAlgorithmic luckiness http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4a21921b61c5168bfa62b274446e12f1Some Sparse Approximation Bounds for Regression Problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bfe47fe651f8a7c92366b4febea04279Gaussian Processes and SVM: Mean Field and Leave-One-Out http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e54ecf29610a30e109f2b1fafbd689cf
