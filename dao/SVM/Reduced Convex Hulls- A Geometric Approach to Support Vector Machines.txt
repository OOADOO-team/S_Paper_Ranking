name: Reduced Convex Hulls: A Geometric Approach to Support Vector Machines [Lecture Notes]url: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/3321859_Reduced_Convex_Hulls_A_Geometric_Approach_to_Support_Vector_Machines_Lecture_Notespublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Sergios Theodoridis,Michael Mavroforakis,abstract: Geometric interpretations of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have introduced the concept of a reduced convex hull. A reduced convex hull is the set of all convex combinations of a set of points where the weight any single point can be assigned is bounded from above by a constant. This paper decouples reduced convex hulls from their origins in SVMs and allows them to be constructed...
