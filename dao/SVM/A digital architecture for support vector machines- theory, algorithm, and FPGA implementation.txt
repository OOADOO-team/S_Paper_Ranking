name: A digital architecture for support vector machines: theory, algorithm, and FPGA implementationurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM18244555public_in: 万方authors: Anguita, D., Boni, A., Ridella, S.,abstract: In this paper, we propose a digital architecture for support  vector machine (SVM) learning and discuss its implementation on a field programmable gate array (FPGA). We analyze briefly the quantization effects on the performance of the SVM in classification problems to show  its robustness, in the feedforward phase, respect to fixed-point math  implementations; then, we address the problem of SVM learning. The  architecture described here makes use of a new algorithm for SVM learning which is less sensitive to quantization errors respect to the solution appeared so far in the literature. The algorithm is composed of  two parts: the first one exploits a recurrent network for finding the  parameters of the SVM; the second one uses a bisection process for computing the threshold. The architecture implementing the algorithm is  described in detail and mapped on a real current-generation FPGA (Xilinx  Virtex II). Its effectiveness is then tested on a channel equalization  problem, where real-time performances are of paramount importancecitations_number: 237Citation: Offline geometric parameters for
