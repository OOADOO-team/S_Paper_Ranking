name: Support vector machines using GMM supervectors for speaker verificationurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/3343440_Support_vector_machines_using_GMM_supervectors_for_speaker_verificationpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Campbell, W.M., Sturim, D.E, Reynolds, D.A.,abstract: Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) have proven extremely successful  for text-independent speaker recognition. The standard training method  for GMM models is to use MAP adaptation of the means of the mixture components based on speech from a target speaker. Recent methods in compensation for speaker and channel variability have proposed the idea of stacking the means of the GMM model to form a GMM mean supervector. We examine the idea of using the GMM supervector in a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. We propose two new SVM kernels based on distance metrics between GMM models. We show that these SVM kernels produce excellent classification accuracy in a NIST speaker recognition evaluation taskcitations_number: 1015Citation: An overview of text-independent speaker recognition: From features to supervectors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=42062a3b66eaea144ad291d329a25784SVM Based Speaker Verification using a GMM Supervector Kernel and NAP Variability Compensation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b104838d9512b53ff547ed2a2eeb4775SVM Based Speaker Verification using a GMM Supervector Kernel and NAP Variability Compensation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=16b172a2f399bc496078a37cdac450a6EmotionSense:a mobile phones based adaptive platform for experimental social psychology research http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7e88ed91c33dd8ecbe39b91055a62176Fusion of Heterogeneous Speaker Recognition Systems in the STBU Submission for the NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation 2006 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2860d5eba3c98f65160d1592fcad509fA novel scheme for speaker recognition using a phonetically-aware deep neural network http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=51d74034797e3e1a30a27b4208acb893Spoofing and countermeasures for speaker verification: A survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1d5e0bb080e8e2be1ea82607014e5fbdEmulating DNA: Rigorous Quantification of Evidential Weight in Transparent and Testable Forensic Speaker Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7dee73d4a56858a236b5a6f3df7d6cd8State-of-the-Art Performance in Text-Independent Speaker Verification Through Open-Source Software http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=59d4c7e35fac3c14fc86c0596579d8faAn Overview of Speaker Identification: Accuracy and Robustness Issues http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d5e29817b053c07ed1a0eb24e734fb78References: Speaker Verification Using Adapted Gaussian Mixture Models \u2606 \u2606\u2606 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=53e7858496bd2863d8642919a163998b[Functional analysis] http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1d9e860fe244af955573ebe66e222176SVMTorch: support vector machines for large-scale regression problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d73d941ff03709380fd407d1b644d45SVMTorch: support vector machines for large-scale regression problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=60a9069d18c3f025967de4fee051828eEigenvoice modeling with sparse training data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=30bde5b6dc67f7466a15918fb8c8ede2Channel robust speaker verification via feature mapping http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=705433d9a6a51affd1b184d15c2b7304Channel robust speaker verification via feature mapping http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9237eb195726d4f09dc574b2d4952148Advances In Channel Compensation For SVM Speaker Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=03c3bb78e297fa077219ef94aec57b89Generalized linear discriminant sequence kernels for speaker recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=72155ed9a837217e8eee9a54fe73c231Speaker verification using sequence discriminant support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ad6784cac58c3017435fe6701c687eecFast approximation of Kullback-Leibler distance for dependence trees and hidden Markov models http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d00c254f5b480f2587a731a24c20903eComments on \"Fast approximation of Kullback-Leibler distance for dependence trees and hidden Markov models\" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1aabb449220aab09145eb99f1d108a37Speaker adaptive cohort selection for tnorm in text-independent speaker verification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=88b1b734f8d4bdf27e93be6dcd8e5786Speaker Verification Using Adapted Gaussian Mixture Models http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=59807b1e8ad92d0844d532180605b294
