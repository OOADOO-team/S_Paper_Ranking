name: Image Classification using Random Forests and Fernsurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221111837_Image_Classification_using_Random_Forests_and_Fernspublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Anna Bosch,Andrew Zisserman,Xavier Munoz,abstract: We explore the problem of classifying images by the object categories they contain in the case of a large number of object categories. To this end we combine three ingredients: (i) shape and appearance representations that support spatial pyramid matching over a region of interest. This generalizes the representation of Lazebnik et al., (2006) from an image to a region of interest (ROI), and from appearance (visual words) alone to appearance and local shape (edge distributions); (ii) automatic selection of the regions of interest in training. This provides a method of inhibiting background clutter and adding invariance to the object instance &#039;s position; and (iii) the use of random forests (and random ferns) as a multi-way classifier. The advantage of such classifiers (over multi-way SVM for example) is the ease of training and testing. Results are reported for classification of the Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 data sets. We compare the performance of the random forest/ferns classifier with a benchmark multi-way SVM classifier. It is shown that selecting the ROI adds about 5% to the performance and, together with the other improvements, the result is about a 10% improvement over the state of the art for Caltech-256.citations_number: 1181Citation: Linear spatial pyramid matching using sparse coding for image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1b277be416a1290d54710a0dd4376505In defense of Nearest-Neighbor based image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=efadc2516d5ed8d8fd4b338b622c75ebSemantic texton forests for image categorization and segmentation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1f4f20148f258caebe88ae2cd99bdd6fVisual Word Ambiguity http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8980d5d5a2edad5b848579059b1ef1f5Class-Specific Hough Forests for Object Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=47b4ed5242295f085dd2bb83ab4566fdFast keypoint recognition using random ferns http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a397b837ada4143ea96b41e86b995726Kernel Codebooks for Scene Categorization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a977773943f21454432920ace6e600bfKernel Codebooks for Scene Categorization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=77e49615c3f233c7e562822302a550c7Multimodal Learning with Deep Boltzmann Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=98cc17d24656a179f09a32b7c69183eaMultimodal templates for real-time detection of texture-less objects in heavily cluttered scenes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=16b4468a926326384aa2246186f130e3References: Distinctive Image Features from Scale-Invariant Keypoints http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c5a2439a680327bb5c666a6eb2ac2d1dLearning Generative Visual Models from Few Training Examples: An Incremental Bayesian Approach Tested on 101 Object Categories http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5d27b97cacf67b587a130bff5bc852bdUsing Iterated Bagging to Debias Regressions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5ef972a3f84aa4e923439250bc8cce6bLocal Features and Kernels for Classification of Texture and Object Categories: A Comprehensive Study http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=91a7db8cacd9398a1c9d764a9385b7ffThe Pyramid Match Kernel: Discriminative Classification with Sets of Image Features http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=51762a06b212b1ff7211275d78432c0bRandom Forests http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=93ad1228381429f80b23922825db0809Random Forests http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=498d2ec77751813bc97aaa7e2e728718
