name: Discriminative Learning Under Covariate Shifturl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/220320527_Discriminative_Learning_Under_Covariate_Shiftpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Steffen Bickel,Michael Br√ºckner,Tobias Scheffer,abstract: We address classification problems for which the training instances are governed by an input distribution that is allowed to differ arbitrarily from the test distribution---problems also referred to as classification under covariate shift. We derive a solution that is purely discriminative: neither training nor test distribution are modeled explicitly. The problem of learning under covariate shift can be written as an integrated optimization problem. Instantiating the general optimization problem leads to a kernel logistic regression and an exponential model classifier for covariate shift. The optimization problem is convex under certain conditions; our findings also clarify the relationship to the known kernel mean matching procedure. We report on experiments on problems of spam filtering, text classification, and landmine detection.citations_number: 136Citation: Domain Adaptation via Transfer Component Analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cca1accda380dd801b4b9836f0208cc6An insight into classification with imbalanced data: Empirical results and current trends on using data intrinsic characteristics http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=96b887f39d2f207b581adeb35d379731Online domain adaptation of a pre-trained cascade of classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c32512d650918eee40f6757f325489b2A unifying view on dataset shift in classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f09d4412b55cf7d1e99dddda5f20d1f4Online Domain Adaptation of a Pre-Trained Cascade of Classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8d75af39c961481ac5a019092818767eUsing active learning to adapt remote sensing image classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=45934de32b4cc4a12473b9cf1d13929dAnalysis of preprocessing vs. cost-sensitive learning for imbalanced classification.
