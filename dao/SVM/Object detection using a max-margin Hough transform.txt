name: Object detection using a max-margin Hough transformurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221361833_Object_detection_using_a_max-margin_Hough_transformpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: S. Maji,J. Malik,abstract: We present a discriminative Hough transform based object detector where each local part casts a weighted vote for the possible locations of the object center. We show that the weights can be learned in a max-margin framework which directly optimizes the classification performance. The discriminative training takes into account both the codebook appearance and the spatial distribution of its position with respect to the object center to derive its importance. On various datasets we show that the discriminative training improves the Hough detector. Combined with a verification step using a SVM based classifier, our approach achieves a detection rate of 91.9% at 0.3 false positives per image on the ETHZ shape dataset, a significant improvement over the state of the art, while running the verification step on at least an order of magnitude fewer windows than in a sliding window approach.citations_number: 394Citation: ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7c535b03f1c730282182f525a307453cSelective Search for Object Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b689fcf3ed998dfbb4213687367b6175Poselets: Body part detectors trained using 3D human pose annotations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f5d914ceaf9f1f48f42efe1fc7394bdeHough Forests for Object Detection, Tracking, and Action Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=711338983f000505a58d0ca6af53c792Category independent object proposals http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f94a7d7db701c5e0689ce02eabcf0d52Segmentation as Selective Search for Object Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d32fd1f895e51c5046ef8341ee0831c3Segmentation as selective search for object recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=400f11df63cb2d4b0572dd6087cc9b4bDetecting People Using Mutually Consistent Poselet Activations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d77eb40a2d0387d36e224fd36368539Recognition using regions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e566af4ac8ef2b1503b99f06bff74e7cHough-based tracking of non-rigid objects http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0e1a897992d6980fc8469d57b9bca7c0References: Use of the Hough transformation to detect lines and curves in pictures http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ae6e9da9a296f2c7aac8202c23e8cd27Training Support Vector Machines: an Application to Face Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a695bfc73b605e2cc76745541a626a3cObject Class Recognition by Unsupervised Scale-Invariant Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f8ae5e602f8bbce5c2a3e0841b649f2dPictorial Structures for Object Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fa170e19ffbaee698eae54d01fb109b9The Pyramid Match Kernel: Discriminative Classification with Sets of Image Features http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=51762a06b212b1ff7211275d78432c0bClassification using intersection kernel support vector machines is efficient http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=20e99a5a65c74f9bc426372844dfd5ebA Trainable System for Object Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5dd7a851a794aeb35d9ee26858421ed4Learning a Sparse Representation for Object Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=699bda4eda2aab7f25933ef1f23e9eeaAn Experimental Study on Pedestrian Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=accb6a16170ea96ef1ff2d60bece8481
