name: Support Vector Clusteringurl: http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/9789814335140_0009public_in: World Scientific Publishingauthors: BenHur, Asa,abstract: We present a novel clustering method using the approach of support vector machines. Data points are mapped by means of a Gaussian kernel to a high dimensional feature space, where we search for the minimal enclosing sphere. This sphere, when mapped back to data space, can separate into several components, each enclosing a separate cluster of points. We present a simple algorithm for identifying these clusters. The width of the Gaussian kernel controls the scale at which the data is probed while the soft margin constant helps coping with outliers and overlapping clusters. The structure of a dataset is explored by varying the two parameters, maintaining a minimal number of support vectors to assure smooth cluster boundaries. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on several datasets.citations_number: 1268Citation: Kernel-based methods for hyperspectral image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=24589a6762785157c11e460107ebf1b6A survey of kernel and spectral methods for clustering http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bb2dd0783665a45399f95a7b64b47edfA survey of kernels for structured data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fd82b70ba08d7d39fabfa5d253eeeb1bThe support vector machine under test http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4643842cf13780d2af64e07a893f22b9A novel kernelized fuzzy C-means algorithm with application in medical image segmentation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=70a5e20dcc166d1576c380f223e8a51eA novel kernel method for clustering http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e1d42c9c1b42dc77712b7c7a82333026Statistical methods for identifying differentially expressed genes in DNA microarrays. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=23d1f5e7eb4f362a3a198ab3832c352dA Novel Kernel Method for Clustering http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7e979071d2238e0589e4cf1fad4ddf50An improved cluster labeling method for support vector clustering http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=723d510272fb05d07d2a8181ecce505bKernels and Distances for Structured Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=396bdab8c629c4e99112ea8016c43392References: Support vector domain description http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ed65222c282e7f21ee66aeecda183410Estimating the Support of a High-Dimensional Distribution http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4ab78b37fddc9f14b8913b4e202b217eIntroduction to statistical pattern recognition (2nd ed.) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f6c8b46c924704a19a37725310d78538An algorithm for generating artificial test clusters http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dc8b45781f2dab945b19c33ca4f94fb1Support vector method for novelty detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=11d79611265fb4402e6d8d8b13725a0bA Support Vector Clustering Method http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c322e38fe80609e222a55c78dcc21d6cAlgorithmic Approaches to Clustering Gene Expression Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a0621731e5bcce7e58e58b9abcce6632Parametric and non-parametric unsupervised cluster analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=54ce07d8f64c28aa0540622693580efbData clustering by Markovian relaxation and the information bottleneck method http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=29d140b55272b667d1d8c8a6c30b8e39Data Clustering Using a Model Granular Magnet http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7e4b97dacef194ad20bbf3f939d78696Clustering Irregular Shapes Using High-Order Neurons http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0f141a0aaf32db70b1bc26f2d2a5e6feSupport vector domain description http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ab04544a6b34668aa3c1badc50c8c1e3
