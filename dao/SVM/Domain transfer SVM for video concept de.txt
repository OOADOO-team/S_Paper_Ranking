name: Domain transfer SVM for video concept detectionurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221362282_Domain_Transfer_SVM_for_video_concept_detectionpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Duan, Lixin,Tsang, Ivor W,Xu, Dong,abstract: Cross-domain learning methods have shown promising results by leveraging labeled patterns from auxiliary domains to learn a robust classifier for target domain, which has a limited number of labeled samples. To cope with the tremendous change of feature distribution between different domains in video concept detection, we propose a new cross-domain kernel learning method. Our method, referred to as Domain Transfer SVM (DTSVM), simultaneously learns a kernel function and a robust SVM classifier by minimizing both the structural risk functional of SVM and the distribution mismatch of labeled and unlabeled samples between the auxiliary and target domains. Comprehensive experiments on the challenging TRECVID corpus demonstrate that DTSVM outperforms existing cross-domain learning and multiple kernel learning methods.citations_number: 222Citation: Adapting visual category models to new domains http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1e62e0c46d664d80bc6c0b15b262df16Adapting Visual Category Models to New Domains http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a149ca0324ba7e51641c393767b3e3b5Adapting Visual Category Models to New Domains http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a575e2c3213dcd0472c7070187e08d41Unbiased look at dataset bias http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=182aebd188805eb06061d066aaf3b2beGeodesic flow kernel for unsupervised domain adaptation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5cd016bd6c11b861931ff2f88be40336What you saw is not what you get: Domain adaptation using asymmetric kernel transforms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4690b77e7aa9c867cc3b06712e06c6ecWhat you saw is not what you get: Domain adaptation using asymmetric kernel transforms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c11ca8c612dee55c2191a87a0f550545Visual Event Recognition in Videos by Learning from Web Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c7fd3618bd9ded49df866c42dd698c42Human reidentification with transferred metric learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=90c1c05d839698f86a2be7c29d5587a4Human Reidentification with Transferred Metric Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5e1e715fbf8b8d4fa7a35c73d6e00a27References: Frustratingly Easy Domain Adaptation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f0f9d973f53224e475fdcf8204b7efafLarge-Scale Concept Ontology for Multimedia http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ae80276c6e24b4bdea922c391fb45581Correcting sample selection bias by unlabeled data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b79c07ebf538af30eca8cb36f3f2c9c3Correcting Sample Selection Bias by Unlabeled Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=81f5154dc606784644ebdf4105016c70Correcting Sample Selection Bias by Unlabeled Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=80d6ee56c7aeff0159dba9c006284169Cross-domain video concept detection using adaptive svms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fbe47b1d77c787341db30420e47f006eTransfer Learning via Dimensionality Reduction. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7f879e2bc8f2fcda93a2532a13d8f854Integrating structured biological data by Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a844a2645185018a5ff0d9be155938caImplicit estimation of wiener series http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=27c5c1cd17e7bf6d81db0a223b9274e4Improving SVM accuracy by training on auxiliary data sources http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9f933afa2ac636e58e1ea529569e4fd6Improving SVM accuracy by training on auxiliary data sources http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=789092f5c8b6fc5af8d06582d5dd4b42High-Level Feature Detection from Video in TRECVid: A 5-Year Retrospective of Achievements http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0c279eeae7209d750d9636282d4c608dHigh-Level Feature Detection from Video in TRECVid: A 5-Year Retrospective of Achievements http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ae2a3d3e8edc5458ef7090bea5ad0ae6Domain Transfer SVM for video concept detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ac9770af46f57e999b04bdcd2e6a55f3Video Event Recognition Using Kernel Methods with Multilevel Temporal Alignment http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=677a15797ccdcf4bd6d88484d2372e0bLarge-scale multimodal semantic concept detection for consumer video http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fd1d1807e56fce224dd55d12f1a98f27Cross-domain learning methods for high-level visual concept classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d2e84da5fea1a5ea23ad7f41c8d01797Mixture regression for covariate shift http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cd09ded2c31e3216d605e0f47dab54d5A walk through the web's video clips http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=018c48f11cc69f0b161182dcb96ac56aMixture Regression for Covariate Shift http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fa4c18eaa5792ca844253961569eac3cA walk through the web\u2019s video clips http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4f0db1917d15fba78aeb150b5b985b7dMixture Regression for Covariate Shift http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4846857f872cad21826f8c4bebd4b9d1
