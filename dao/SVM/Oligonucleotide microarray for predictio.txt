name: Oligonucleotide microarray for prediction of early intrahepatic recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after curative resection.url: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/s0140673603127754public_in: Elsevierauthors: YamadaOkabe H,abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma has a poor prognosis because of the high intrahepatic recurrence rate. There are technological limitations to traditional methods such as TNM staging for accurate prediction of recurrence, suggesting that new techniques are needed. We investigated mRNA expression profiles in tissue specimens from a training set, comprising 33 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, with high-density oligonucleotide microarrays representing about 6000 genes. We used this training set in a supervised learning manner to construct a predictive system, consisting of 12 genes, with the Fisher linear classifier. We then compared the predictive performance of our system with that of a predictive system with a support vector machine (SVM-based system) on a blinded set of samples from 27 newly enrolled patients. Early intrahepatic recurrence within 1 year after curative surgery occurred in 12 (36%) and eight (30%) patients in the training and blinded sets, respectively. Our system correctly predicted early intrahepatic recurrence or non-recurrence in 25 (93%) of 27 samples in the blinded set and had a positive predictive value of 88% and a negative predictive value of 95%. By contrast, the SVM-based system predicted early intrahepatic recurrence or non-recurrence correctly in only 16 (60%) individuals in the blinded set, and the result yielded a positive predictive value of only 38% and a negative predictive value of 79%. Our system predicted early intrahepatic recurrence or non-recurrence for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma much more accurately than the SVM-based system, suggesting that our system could serve as a new method for characterising the metastatic potential of hepatocellular carcinoma.citations_number: 870Citation: Multi-institutional randomized phase II trial of gefitinib for previously treated patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (The IDEAL 1 Trial) [co... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1259ac53b07b0d3da2b94f22afcab8c2PRODRG: a tool for high-throughput crystallography of protein\u2013ligand complexes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b03c3e7ee3509979aac0ae67a70629baRandomized phase III trial of pemetrexed versus docetaxel in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer previously treated with chemotherapy. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c2569318b4d0d5114daee4ed499fa92bSystematic review of randomized trials for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: Chemoembolization improves survival. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=074126d6e37e09cfdb7a9f3dc920321eIdentification of the transforming EML4-ALK fusion gene in non-small-cell lung cancer. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=21e7a6bcf7bc1834b2ef82d8520b82cdManagement of hepatocellular carcinoma: An update http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7191f5b658f04a80c09f062bdfa9608eClinical efficacy of a RAF inhibitor needs broad target blockade in BRAF-mutant melanoma http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8b292c5f9cc1de3a05cbc52f5cffdccaCetuximab and chemotherapy as initial treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=02290f99a8400ba59de1531425cf2ce4Solution hybrid selection with ultra-long oligonucleotides for massively parallel targeted sequencing. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4ac1f10e59b77e7bccae3102adebd0c9Cancer as an evolutionary and ecological process. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=753a85318c56d7553df88ec0580e1f3eReferences: Statistical pattern recognition: a review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=079121efa11798514b67b66d00de4289Natural history of liver fibrosis progression in patients with chronic hepatitis C.
