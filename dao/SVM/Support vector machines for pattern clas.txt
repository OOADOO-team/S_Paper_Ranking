name: Support vector machines for pattern classificationurl: http://www.springerlink.com/content/m55835public_in: Springerauthors: Abe, S,abstract: In conventional support vector machines (SVMs), an n-class problem is converted into n two-class problems. For the ith two-class problem we determine the optimal decision function which separates class i from the remaining classes. In classification, a datum is classified into class i only when the value of the ith decision function is positive. In this architecture, the datum is unclassifiable if the values of more than one decision function are positive or all the valves are negative. In the paper, to overcome this problem, we propose fuzzy support vector machines (FSVMs). Using the decision functions obtained by training the SVM, for each class, we define a truncated polyhedral pyramidal membership function. Since, for the data in the classifiable regions, the classification results are the same for the two methods, the generalization ability of the FSVM is the same as or better than that of the SVM. We evaluate our method for three benchmark data sets and demonstrate the superiority of the FSVM over the SVMcitations_number: 357Citation: A Survey on Machine-Learning Techniques in Cognitive Radios http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4e278c7227520f84f2bd75d178a08877Classification of EMG signals using PSO optimized SVM for diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8369c131d304063394048b8fa5408cffSupport vector machine applications in the field of hydrology: A review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d8ece1cbd226a3e28d64dc8010ea7bdbFacing Imbalanced Data - Recommendations for the Use of Performance Metrics http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=03a678e7b91668b70d17b4a502741f92User Authentication Through Mouse Dynamics http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1622ec3fbae3cf007839b72d8fa424fbFuzzy support vector machine based on within-class scatter for classification problems with outliers or noises http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5c307ca83c6436d1a02fb6828f0885acHigh-dimensional and large-scale anomaly detection using a linear one-class SVM with deep learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a6f3b174c229043cb6d9a3e0564f509c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5929\u6c14\u72b6\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5149\u4f0f\u7535\u7ad9\u53d1\u7535\u529f\u7387\u5206\u7c7b\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7f6e07f1251ce30073b5b60b155577e8Solar irradiance feature extraction and support vector machines based weather status pattern recognition model for short-term photovoltaic power forecasting http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0354e2c693510ed058ceaee35124059eMachine learning algorithms and forced oscillation measurements to categorise the airway obstruction severity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d3c8251306c80d717125ac0607c53ac0References: Pairwise classification and support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c18fefa1742e2a2482a5814b753e5d63An empirical comparison of pattern recognition, neural nets, and machine learning classification methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0c5f3b9eec84e3c88b2a0f6b521d00b3Pattern Classification: Neuro-fuzzy Methods and Their Comparison http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5f90091fd9b9fd00e2ced340a8155eb6Input layer optimization of neural networks by sensitivity analysis and its application to recognition of numerals http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d3c0eab4e4089511725471e2200a4b7a
