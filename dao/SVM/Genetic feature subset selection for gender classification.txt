name: Genetic feature subset selection for gender classificationurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2551774_Genetic_Feature_Subset_Selection_for_Gender_Classification_A_Comparison_Studypublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Sun, Zehang,Yuan, Xiaojing,Louis, Sushil J,abstract: We consider the problem of gender classification from frontal facial images using genetic feature subset selection. We argue that feature selection is an important issue in gender classification and demonstrate that Genetic Algorithms (GA) can select good subsets of features (i.e., features that encode mostly gender information), reducing the classification error. First, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to represent each image as a feature vector (i.e., eigen-features) in a low-dimensional space. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are then employed to select a subset of features from the low-dimensional representation by disregarding certain eigenvectors that do not seem to encode important gender information. Four different classifiers were compared in this study using genetic feature subset selection: a Bayes classifier, a Neural Network (NN) classifier, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, and a classifier based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Our experimental results show a significant error rate reduction in all cases. The best performance was obtained using the SVM classifier. Using only 8.4% of the features in the complete set, the SVM classifier achieved an error rate of 4.7% from an average error rate of 8.9% using manually selected features.citations_number: 204Citation: Object detection using feature subset selection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c8abfd59be5df5da8db023aca1af5c04On-road vehicle detection using evolutionary Gabor filter optimization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=abc480bf800c7c4e9c053f345b227175Monocular precrash vehicle detection: features and classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=82512ecf57ae3dde0caa21f29de0fe0cMonocular precrash vehicle detection: features and classifiers. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=866b3c74c6edc4628319f3bb1c4cab04An experimental comparison of gender classification methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=536d0965934bcc4fef73bda7f145891fInfrared and visible image fusion for face recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f3b1bed56adffd35de00478f1949a830GA-fisher: a new LDA-based face recognition algorithm with selection of principal components http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=10b2dcbf5fa9033aed1fefc4c1111164Integrating Independent Components and Support Vector Machines for Gender Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=16d71674f7cba33af8a95fc8e861ab6dBag of soft biometrics for person identification: New trends and challenges http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cc321ad60b2fd0caf1455d7f55427d07A Local Region-based Approach to Gender Classi.cation From Face Images http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c4da90e2a45902bc86e7cc8609c1dd15References: Eigenfaces for Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3cdaa220ced0e430bf3f6739ca60fc69Feature selection: evaluation, application, and small sample performance http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fdd0366ef52ce53d2e3c7865ee1206deGenetic algorithms: a survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4c528037cb1eac675ceee3cfd7106d26Feature Subset Selection Using a Genetic Algorithm http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f39365f5ff65c7fcdcd64e9facb02757Feature Subset Selection Using a Genetic Algorithm http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=89674793d269efaae2c354cabc6288b1The CHC Adaptive Search Algorithm: How to Have Safe Search When Engaging in Nontraditional Genetic Recombination http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f5f00ca07656f55d73401c77a08e7286A note on genetic algorithms for large-scale feature selection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e0a8e95adea89d7edca6cedc2fe1f1efSexNet: A neural network identifies sex from human faces http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2765cd536f654ab6c7b419fce17760bbSEXNET: A Neural Network Identifies Sex From Human Faces. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e0d5ea9f6d6567d294d9630aeb1228d3ON AUTOMATIC FEATURE SELECTION http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4c70de84fe6ea5e24e56ab04824218a8What's the difference between men and women?
