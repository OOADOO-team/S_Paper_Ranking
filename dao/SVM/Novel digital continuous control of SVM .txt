name: Novel digital continuous control of SVM inverters in the overmodulation rangeurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/3170313_Novel_digital_continuous_control_of_SVM_inverters_in_the_overmodulation_rangepublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Bolognani, Silverio,Zigliotto, Mauro,abstract: A novel technique for space-vector modulation (SVM) inverters in the overmodulation range is presented. A unique algorithm manages the transition from the onset of overmodulation to six-step operation. The technique is suitable for a very simple digital implementation. Experimental results, obtained by a digital signal processor (DSP) board, are also included in this papercitations_number: 198Citation: Sensorless full-digital PMSM Drive with EKF estimation of speed and rotor position http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fbcd9ed7722a0d399f87228f57085335A neural-network-based space-vector PWM controller for a three-level voltage-fed inverter induction motor drive http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e9d80e97665a9c7bee0719245be458f2Carrier-based PWM-VSI overmodulation strategies: analysis, comparison, and design http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=458f189c0ee9a6e2bf0b25550c111a47A neural network based space vector PWM controller for a three-level voltage-fed inverter induction motor drive http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f676dc452447191eff58ee197ff32e68A Novel Overmodulation Technique for Space-Vector PWM Inverters pdf http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c2575e78a2949f0381871347cef756b5A General Space Vector PWM Algorithm for Multilevel Inverters, Including Operation in Overmodulation Range http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e19c7b3ef5b0676cbfc6262fffab787eA General Space Vector PWM Algorithm for Multilevel Inverters, Including Operation in Overmodulation Range http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cab314c41e72d5c5e4e2f565b0e4717dInnovative remedial strategies for inverter faults in IPM synchronous motor drives http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6d9675af050c67f9975115d37902a692\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u6ce2\u7535\u538b\u5e45\u503c\u7ebf\u6027\u8f93\u51fa\u63a7\u5236\u7684 SVPWM\u8fc7\u8c03\u5236\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=59dfcec9bebe4963de617cdd4785fe11Comprehensive study on space-vector-PWM and carrier-based-PWM correlation in multilevel invertors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4aeb85d81f68f3d7c550a19e96918636References: Analysis and realization of a pulsewidth modulator based on voltage space vectors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9831446f784350c5cdaef41b4c1a6d29Pulsewidth modulation--A survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=75da0348442c1145ec2181215d860a1bControl of PWM voltage inverters in the pulse dropping region http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5f18e46ac0952026056f6026992e25bdSpace vector Fourier analysis of SVM inverters in the overmodulation range http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5b05f0aa94560b5c03844c58f5df6eceAn overmodulation strategy for PWM voltage inverters http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=67ed9154266591c7bddef4e9a3ba13bePulsewidth modulation--A survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=69024e52d8214f3d04556a2246a40601
