name: Parameter determination of support vector machine and feature selection using simulated annealing approachurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156849460700141Xpublic_in: Elsevierauthors: ShihWei Lin,ZneJung Lee,ShihChieh Chen,abstract: Support vector machine (SVM) is a novel pattern classification method that is valuable in many applications. Kernel parameter setting in the SVM training process, along with the feature selection, significantly affects classification accuracy. The objective of this study is to obtain the better parameter values while also finding a subset of features that does not degrade the SVM classification accuracy. This study develops a simulated annealing (SA) approach for parameter determination and feature selection in the SVM, termed SA-SVM. To measure the proposed SA-SVM approach, several datasets in UCI machine learning repository are adopted to calculate the classification accuracy rate. The proposed approach was compared with grid search which is a conventional method of performing parameter setting, and various other methods. Experimental results indicate that the classification accuracy rates of the proposed approach exceed those of grid search and other approaches. The SA-SVM is thus useful for parameter determination and feature selection in the SVM.citations_number: 210Citation: Binary PSO with mutation operator for feature selection using decision tree applied to spam detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=85ddd7925cc42a522ae17b6450097b56Support vector machines in water quality management http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d74bde3a7e724ee804a403a565a57843An intelligent algorithm with feature selection and decision rules applied to anomaly intrusion detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=23a0f78cf1fcef5e6ab54a3ceb7d8cc1Fast and efficient strategies for model selection of Gaussian support vector machine. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f2dc4eb00f2285d5b9ed1fb397f66047Feature evaluation and selection with cooperative game theory http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a76c4620855b3083bbcb4b1dd367b0aeAn optimal fuzzy control system in a network environment based on simulated annealing.
