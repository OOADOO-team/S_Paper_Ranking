name: A novel transductive SVM for semisupervised classification of remote sensing imagesurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/4182662_Transductive_SVMs_for_semisupervised_classification_of_hyperspectral_datapublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Lorenzo Bruzzone,abstract: This paper introduces a semisupervised classification method that exploits both labeled and unlabeled samples for addressing ill-posed problems with support vector machines (SVMs). The method is based on recent developments in statistical learning theory concerning transductive inference and in particular transductive SVMs (TSVMs). TSVMs exploit specific iterative algorithms which gradually search a reliable separating hyperplane (in the kernel space) with a transductive process that incorporates both labeled and unlabeled samples in the training phase. Based on an analysis of the properties of the TSVMs presented in the literature, a novel modified TSVM classifier designed for addressing ill-posed remote-sensing problems is proposed. In particular, the proposed technique: 1) is based on a novel transductive procedure that exploits a weighting strategy for unlabeled patterns, based on a time-dependent criterion; 2) is able to mitigate the effects of suboptimal model selection (which is unavoidable in the presence of small-size training sets); and 3) can address multiclass cases. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method on a set of ill-posed remote-sensing classification problems representing different operative conditionscitations_number: 397Citation: Recent advances in techniques for hyperspectral image processing http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f39837310d5e740098e4954fb877ed95Spectral and Spatial Classification of Hyperspectral Data Using SVMs and Morphological Profiles http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=45f8da7eb360ce74d3c53cf6e2486f20Spectral and spatial classification of hyperspectral data using SVMs and morphological profiles http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7521f1573b4a059d154211672db30fa8Semi-Supervised Graph-Based Hyperspectral Image Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=04771a2af51077b8805c65424d72d467Hyperspectral Image Classification Using Dictionary-Based Sparse Representation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=35f892049c9546a82a0da1b92fcc123bHyperspectral Remote Sensing Data Analysis and Future Challenges http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=11c5767188ab4962a6f1bba1b02dc053Urban-Area and Building Detection Using SIFT Keypoints and Graph Theory http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=273ee52129735145e747f0b7f1c5bbcbSemisupervised Hyperspectral Image Segmentation Using Multinomial Logistic Regression With Active Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=99f11fa8e833f16bcd91ff331294fb54Hyperspectral Image Segmentation Using a New Bayesian Approach With Active Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2233088a308e326fa54994fb7c00c4f3A Support Vector Domain Description Approach to Supervised Classification of Remote Sensing Images http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=498ca8e0855c7b0255ea4d13da23bf33References: On the mean accuracy of statistical pattern recognizers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2429697126fea3454cc0552505a343a9Classification of hyperspectral remote sensing images with support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=302d09839efa8d5f2df65ef43aa5f82cSemi-supervised support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9130a5c6a977596ee68f31e7fd20b93eKernel-based methods for hyperspectral image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=24589a6762785157c11e460107ebf1b6The effect of unlabeled samples in reducing the small sample size problem and mitigating the Hughes phenomenon http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b702e770db0d641d5020cd6fd219f4acPrior knowledge in support vector kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=452c6d26b04c29ee5593f5d7e08c08c8Learning with progressive transductive support vector machine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9fae874c9cab5d3adca9a71417da2320Data classification with radial basis function networks based on a novel kernel density estimation algorithm. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7463d594d4a5de8256749f8d1a56cae0From regularization operators to support vector kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=eb01aca4a73e80b353e14799d80df963Learning with Progressive Transductive Support Vector Machine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2c42ef5e93f8b796613699dbb4a1ab70Robust parameter estimation for mixture model http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=83de57eb0fcf4b9da007328f7ea3c225Quality Assessment of Classification and Cluster Maps Without Ground Truth Knowledge http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ac1932eacb8048c05dacb35a1b9c143fA cost-effective semisupervised classifier approach with kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=64cc9021ec19b6ad2c734677b632e9a4A semilabeled-sample-driven bagging technique for ill-posed classification problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=db4b30f713bb43834acc47049825dd89An adaptive method for combined covariance estimation and classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4bbccab47ce9c2b59419952a32ec5bcaAn ensemble-driven k-NN approach to ill-posed classification problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=976951a6672b932f0e748011f8d2804dSupport vector machine learning algorithm and transduction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=087138c56b5a916935962d6d7683346fOn the mean accuracy of statistical pattern recognizers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1b2f50292078d07261093576504dcbbf
