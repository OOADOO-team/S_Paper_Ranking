Berg,M. Maire,abstract: We consider visual category recognition in the framework of measuring similarities, or equivalently perceptual distances, to prototype examples of categories. This approach is quite flexible, and permits recognition based on color, texture, and particularly shape, in a homogeneous framework. While nearest neighbor classifiers are natural in this setting, they suffer from the problem of high variance (in bias-variance decomposition) in the case of limited sampling. Alternatively, one could use support vector machines but they involve time-consuming optimization and computation of pairwise distances. We propose a hybrid of these two methods which deals naturally with the multiclass setting, has reasonable computational complexity both in training and at run time, and yields excellent results in practice. The basic idea is to find close neighbors to a query sample and train a local support vector machine that preserves the distance function on the collection of neighbors. Our method can be applied to large, multiclass data sets for which it outperforms nearest neighbor and support vector machines, and remains efficient when the problem becomes intractable for support vector machines. A wide variety of distance functions can be used and our experiments show state-of-the-art performance on a number of benchmark data sets for shape and texture classification (MNIST, USPS, CUReT) and object recognition (Caltech- 101). On Caltech-101 we achieved a correct classification rate of 59.05%(±0.56%) at 15 training images per class, and 66.23%(±0.48%) at 30 training images.citations_number: 1178Citation: Linear spatial pyramid matching using sparse coding for image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1b277be416a1290d54710a0dd4376505Locality-constrained Linear Coding for image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a7972b7d93fe3ef49f9e348f488ded39Locality-constrained Linear Coding for image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9d1fc0a6aedf5f4675d67b6f1ff4b55fImage Classification using Random Forests and Ferns http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=91b2ec950974b5b10f1e855fe1b7dab3In defense of Nearest-Neighbor based image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=efadc2516d5ed8d8fd4b338b622c75ebNon-negative Locality-Constrained Linear Coding for Image Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5fa4935c569c7576a12263ed07e3ba8cWhat is the best multi-stage architecture for object recognition?
