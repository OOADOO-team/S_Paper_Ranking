name: A real-valued genetic algorithm to optimize the parameters support vector machine for predicting bankruptcyurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417405003490public_in: Elsevierauthors: Chih-Hung Wu,Gwo-Hshiung Tzeng,Yeong-Jia Goo,abstract: Two parameters, and , must be carefully predetermined in establishing an efficient support vector machine (SVM) model. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a genetic-based SVM (GA-SVM) model that can automatically determine the optimal parameters, and , of SVM with the highest predictive accuracy and generalization ability simultaneously. This paper pioneered on employing a real-valued genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the parameters of SVM for predicting bankruptcy. Additionally, the proposed GA-SVM model was tested on the prediction of financial crisis in Taiwan to compare the accuracy of the proposed GA-SVM model with that of other models in multivariate statistics (DA, logit, and probit) and artificial intelligence (NN and SVM). Experimental results show that the GA-SVM model performs the best predictive accuracy, implying that integrating the RGA with traditional SVM model is very successful.citations_number: 371Citation:
