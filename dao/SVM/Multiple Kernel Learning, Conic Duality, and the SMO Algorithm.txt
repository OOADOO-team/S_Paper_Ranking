name: Multiple Kernel Learning, Conic Duality, and the SMO Algorithmurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2949028_Multiple_Kernel_Learning_Conic_Duality_and_the_SMO_Algorithmpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Francis R. Bach,Gert R. G. Lanckriet,Michael I. Jordan,abstract: While classical kernel-based classifiers are based on a single kernel, in practice it is often desirable to base classifiers on combinations of multiple kernels. Lanckriet et al. (2004) considered conic combinations of kernel matrices for the support vector machine (SVM), and showed that the optimization of the coefficients of such a combination reduces to a convex optimization problem known as a quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP). Unfortunately, current convex optimization toolboxes can solve this problem only for a small number of kernels and a small number of data points; moreover, the sequential minimal optimization (SMO) techniques that are essential in large-scale implementations of the SVM cannot be applied because the cost function is non-differentiable. We propose a novel dual formulation of the QCQP as a second-order cone programming problem, and show how to exploit the technique of Moreau-Yosida regularization to yield a formulation to which SMO techniques can be applied. We present experimental results that show that our SMO-based algorithm is significantly more efficient than the general-purpose interior point methods available in current optimization toolboxes.citations_number: 1387Citation: Large Scale Multiple Kernel Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=831d607d441e2e61d3b96faff8933beeRepresenting shape with a spatial pyramid kernel http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b753a99c294292d307aaee6e59498f57On feature combination for multiclass object classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c7d1a7c6283c15fea5f2257842f80a99Multiple Kernel Learning Algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4b5eaf8b81682322ba25e45541ed81f2Simplemkl http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b496d7b74c49e33b433befff447a37b0Learning The Discriminative Power-Invariance Trade-Off http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5fd8f3ed11917d0576b16217f09991baOptimization with Sparsity-Inducing Penalties http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fee654224b8a79ce52077f4a57b3e9b8More generality in efficient multiple kernel learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cbe32091bea9a331978316569adc6e65Joint covariate selection and joint subspace selection for multiple classification problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b806fa458cbf387aa7e7bf79fd49e39aReferences: Learning the Kernel Matrix with Semi-Definite Programming. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=599f68acd7b267d7a31fe23b626a4cdeMaking large-scale support vector machine learning practical http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d173cb9f98a78ed94ab46461e4ac0185Algorithms for Minimization Without Derivatives http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=acbaa8d25ff65430206dfa49852bc243Table errata: Algorithms for minimization without derivatives (Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.
