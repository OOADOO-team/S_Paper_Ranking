name: A comparison of software and hardware techniques for x86 virtualizationurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/220938865_A_comparison_of_software_and_hardware_techniques_for_x86_virtualizationpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Keith Adams,Ole Agesen,abstract: Until recently, the x86 architecture has not permitted classical trap-and-emulate virtualization. Virtual Machine Monitors for x86, such as VMware &amp;#174; Workstation and Virtual PC, have instead used binary translation of the guest kernel code. However, both Intel and AMD have now introduced architectural extensions to support classical virtualization.We compare an existing software VMM with a new VMM designed for the emerging hardware support. Surprisingly, the hardware VMM often suffers lower performance than the pure software VMM. To determine why, we study architecture-level events such as page table updates, context switches and I/O, and find their costs vastly different among native, software VMM and hardware VMM execution.We find that the hardware support fails to provide an unambiguous performance advantage for two primary reasons: first, it offers no support for MMU virtualization; second, it fails to co-exist with existing software techniques for MMU virtualization. We look ahead to emerging techniques for addressing this MMU virtualization problem in the context of hardware-assisted virtualization.citations_number: 876Citation: The Eucalyptus Open-Source Cloud-Computing System http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cfb58a00316880f15680daf9cbd2c564A comparison of software and hardware techniques for x86 virtualization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c4bf80d60f4ed6d85d8dbc176e24a1b6A comparison of software and hardware techniques for x86 virtualization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0cae87ae8b5f2917b14ea870be5e38f0Scheduling I\/O in virtual machine monitors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ec0a1f0f04a8aede5fa592d96edfccd8A Survey of Computation Offloading for Mobile Systems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9ca8c939fd5779d31cba22e9570aaca2NOVA:a microhypervisor-based secure virtualization architecture http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a48bd59074426be34440c41f601a039bHypervisor support for identifying covertly executing binaries http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2175471842fa10013088c103f41bc5acBridging the Gap between Software and Hardware Techniques for I\/O Virtualization. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=50a8215fa088f6b4d929b38e1a0296c5Bridging the Gap between Software and Hardware Techniques for I\/O Virtualization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d17fdf5c51845a2c817a5f63e6ca90b2Concurrent Direct Network Access for Virtual Machine Monitors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ef9aebfc29e86d3a031abf6d074508a5References: Intel Virtualization Technology http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=17319f056765a492fa621d47b873a59eShade: A Fast Instruction-Set Simulator for Execution Profiling http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=332af0b5eac6428c23c42bf500a9db46Shade: a fast instruction-set simulator for execution profiling http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=51bcea269515d3667433ad93be195e5aFormal requirements for virtualizable third generation architectures http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ec547e6ae5d34926fc4f898e88e18d82Virtual Machines: Versatile Platforms for Systems and Processes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e08284a0370ceafb697ee89f0be4e8f1A comparison of software and hardware techniques for x86 virtualization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c4bf80d60f4ed6d85d8dbc176e24a1b6A comparison of software and hardware techniques for x86 virtualization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0cae87ae8b5f2917b14ea870be5e38f0Scale and performance in the Denali isolation kernel http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6e5b3cfaff01baf2abd2dcbce399390bThe Origin of the VM\/370 Time-Sharing System http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bc1f23d0860be167c1aa77954375fe62Embra: fast and flexible machine simulation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=462b5d350e61d2ec1df9a9e9536ad572The Transmeta Code Morphing\u2122 Software: Using Speculation, Recovery, and Adaptive Retranslation to Address Real-Life Challenges http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fed57107ef271d019005d263d0fcf3d3et al.
