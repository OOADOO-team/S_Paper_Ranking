name: Face detection using discriminating feature analysis and Support Vector Machineurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320305002682public_in: Elsevierauthors: Peichung Shih, Chengjun Liu,abstract: This paper presents a novel face detection method by applying  discriminating feature analysis (DFA) and support vector machine (SVM). The novelty of our DFA-SVM method comes from the integration of DFA, face class modeling, and SVM for face detection. First, DFA derives a discriminating feature vector by combining the input image, its 1-D Haar  wavelet representation, and its amplitude projections. While the Haar  wavelets produce an effective representation for object detection, the  amplitude projections capture the vertical symmetric distributions and  the horizontal characteristics of human face images. Second, face class  modeling estimates the probability density function of the face class  and defines a distribution-based measure for face and nonface  classification. The distribution-based measure thus separates the input  patterns into three classes: the face class (patterns close to the face  class), the nonface class (patterns far away from the face class), and  the undecided class (patterns neither close to nor far away from the  face class). Finally, SVM together with the distribution-based measure  classifies the patterns in the undecided class into either the face  class or the nonface class. Experiments using images from the MIT-CMU  test sets demonstrate the feasibility of our new face detection method.  In particular, when using 92 images (containing 282 faces) from the  MIT-CMU test sets, our DFA-SVM method achieves 98.2% correct face  detection rate with two false detections.
