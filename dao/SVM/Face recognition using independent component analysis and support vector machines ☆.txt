name: Face recognition using independent component analysis and support vector machines ☆url: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865503000813public_in: Elsevierauthors: Oscar Déniz,Modesto Castrillón Santana,Mario Hernández,abstract: Support vector machines (SVM) and independent component analysis (ICA) are two powerful and relatively recent techniques. SVMs are classifiers which have demonstrated high generalization capabilities in many different tasks, including the object recognition problem. ICA is a feature extraction technique which can be considered a generalization of principal component analysis (PCA). ICA has been mainly used on the problem of blind signal separation. In this paper we combine these two techniques for the face recognition problem. Experiments were made on two different face databases, achieving very high recognition rates. As the results using the combination PCA/SVM were not very far from those obtained with ICA/SVM, our experiments suggest that SVMs are relatively insensitive to the representation space. Thus as the training time for ICA is much larger than that of PCA, this result indicates that the best practical combination is PCA with SVM.citations_number: 292Citation: \u7efc\u8ff0\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5e5bb128ea09f4df9685efaf987ed4eeFinancial time series forecasting using independent component analysis and support vector regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=12b8366ebe7b307109643d19e68f4a20An efficient illumination normalization method for face recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=73d706d501673c4120aea40cb825db6eFace recognition using an enhanced independent component analysis approach. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fc3517932c8d3b8ca9a546c5a35d35b6Gait recognition for human identification based on ICA and fuzzy SVM through multiple views fusion http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c834f198e35b3952791d2dc642fafabaA Kernel Fuzzy c-Means Clustering-Based Fuzzy Support Vector Machine Algorithm for Classification Problems With Outliers or Noises http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=63848fd7224746068d14617f8e6d5504A comparative study of automatic face verification algorithms on the BANCA database http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8a5f40d85b5383f78ebedf267d46b3c2An independent component analysis-based filter design for defect detection in low-contrast surface images http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a9b49222173a582ab2803afd9e3ecbbbSupport vector machine-based image classification for genetic syndrome diagnosis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=789ad6000a3d83f4fc5bfb1ad1351526A Comparative Study of Automatic Face Verification Algorithms on the BANCA Database http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1af99e45599412521eb3c16121c27e92References: Independent Component Analysis of Electroencephalographic and Event-Related Potential Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5c6ee13a0394bd925de82d70324f23f4Automatic recognition and analysis of human faces and facial expressions: a survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=55b6b82a4799b7e71f3cdc6156dd49f5Extraction of ocular artefacts from EEG using independent component analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1aa304a971fa8e2559caf1dafe78d10eIndependent Component Analysis for Identification of Artifacts in Magnetoencephalographic Recordings. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=55f93214d99de2edecae19b83bc14aafA First Application of Independent Component Analysis to Extracting Structure from Stock Returns http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=10b98501c11b1fe53d49945ea304f067Support vector machines for histogram-based image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5b22b8f6a125bdf4116c7456ac0960feIndependent Component Analysis of Electroencephalographic and Event-Related Potential Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=de737ed2c4643266f7260380fe4c0aebIndependent component analysis of electroencephalographic signals http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=98ec4dd94c1b156c6334d920f4bd2bbf
