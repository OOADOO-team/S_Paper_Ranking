name: A novel method of protein secondary structure prediction with high segment overlap measure: support vector machine approachurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283601945802public_in: Elsevierauthors: Sujun Hua, Zhirong Sun,abstract: We have introduced a new method of protein secondary structure prediction which is based on the theory of support vector machine (SVM). SVM represents a new approach to supervised pattern classification which has been successfully applied to a wide range of pattern recognition problems, including object recognition, speaker identification, gene function prediction with microarray expression profile, etc. In these cases, the performance of SVM either matches or is significantly better than that of traditional machine learning approaches, including neural networks. The first use of the SVM approach to predict protein secondary structure is described here. Unlike the previous studies, we first constructed several binary classifiers, then assembled a tertiary classifier for three secondary structure states (helix, sheet and coil) based on these binary classifiers. The SVM method achieved a good performance of segment overlap accuracy SOV = 76.2% through sevenfold cross validation on a database of 513 non-homologous protein chains with multiple sequence alignments, which out-performs existing methods. Meanwhile three-state overall per-residue accuracy Q3 achieved 73.5%, which is at least comparable to existing single prediction methods. Furthermore a useful &quot;reliability index&quot; for the predictions was developed. In addition, SVM has many attractive features, including effective avoidance of overfitting, the ability to handle large feature spaces, information condensing of the given data set, etc. The SVM method is conveniently applied to many other pattern classification tasks in biology.citations_number: 747Citation: Support vector machine approach for protein subcellular localization prediction. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=324c2be95b8ee4f80a0f894d99893a04Support Vector Machines: Theory and Applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=be865e23f2cfc49e299dc71c30e57f28Prediction of protein subcellular locations by support vector machines using compositions of amino acids and amino acid pairs http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=87ad10f5a335e08cdbfdcbca9044890dSupport Vector Machines: Theory and Applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c28dbe2941a697b57ba9ffa3c0988ccdSupport Vector Machines: Theory and Applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=77aa80111657f84192adc8396db9589bPrediction of Protein Subcellular Localizations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fff371ce81eb7c1dbe0adb25b633c593Prediction of protein subcellular localization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=15dfbc30755ae4cdca727f5fb3646057Improved prediction of protein--protein binding sites using a support vector machines approach http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=67e5ab2944acff9b53009108689c83b9Data Mining With Computational Intelligence http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=baed607c40e171d5ccd885b8080a042fData Mining with Computational Intelligence http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=967aeb2b7fb52e9ddbb75ed8426e5a27References: Extracting support data for a given task http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8c6d264ed3c1a6c55fe034331f12c99cThe SWISS-PROT Protein Sequence Data Bank and Its New Supplement TREMBL http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e141109a66dd86e2bb19f7d2ae3c41b2Identification of structural motifs from protein coordinate data: secondary structure and first-level supersecondary structure. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=70c75414371f4943ebfcbb01527b3522The HSSP database of protein structure\u2014sequence alignments and family profiles http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cc5a4ded2d3ddb2677da75f7f3dc0990Exploiting the past and the future in protein secondary structure prediction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1c684d54121362b43f231302b4da154aPrediction of protein secondary structure by combining nearest-neighbor algorithms and multiple sequence alignments. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=44acac69d00a72e9eaa300fa67660432Redefining the goals of protein secondary structure prediction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9b6ac5302968623b18854406bae50eaaUsing class-center vectors to build support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=59da511b61440bd30614c32bf875de44HSSP data base of protein structure-sequence alighments http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8a5a7af0d48d394ed3e1100336e00650Hybrid system for protein secondary structure prediction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ea3856613c2373c0d14e6e8f3ad387ddA modified definition of Sov, a segment-based measure for protein secondary structure prediction assessment. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4ef6d07e0c4242a5b8b2fffff6862f2cThe Second Georgia Tech International Conference on Bioinformatics: Sequence, Structure and Function.
