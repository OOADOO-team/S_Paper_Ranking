name: SVMTorch: support vector machines for large-scale regression problemsurl: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=944738public_in: ACMauthors: Ronan Collobert,Samy Bengio,abstract: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for regression problems are trained by solving a quadratic optimization problem which needs on the order of l[sup 2] memory and time resources to solve, where l is the number of training examples. In this paper, we propose a decomposition algorithm, SVMTorch[sup 1], which is similar to SVM-Light proposed by Joachims (1999) for classification problems, but adapted to regression problems. With this algorithm, one can now efficiently solve large-scale regression problems (more than 20000 examples). Comparisons with Nodelib, another publicly available SVM algorithm for large-scale regression problems from Flake and Lawrence (2000) yielded significant time improvements. Finally, based on a recent paper from Lin (2000), we show that a convergence proof exists for our algorithm.citations_number: 1141Citation: On the algorithmic implementation of multiclass kernel-based vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b47acd19b1fd48eebecffeb19e54274fIn Defense of One-Vs-All Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1cb6ad251520eb88ba4e0d79c20b564eHAMMER: Hierarchical Attribute Matching Mechanism for Elastic Registration http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=508b2a4f36081a16b2a3efa6e9066b81Cutting-plane training of structural SVMs http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=89d31a15aa09826faae2706f7088bfc2HAMMER: hierarchical attribute matching mechanism for elastic registration. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fed72e35bd3c9e9519af2ecfbc80c67cSupport vector machines using GMM supervectors for speaker verification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8d8ec04ebacbf78b890c0d9a95852ea7Gaussian processes for machine learning \/ http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=20f73cdb8b10dc884f65b042da2943f1SVM Based Speaker Verification using a GMM Supervector Kernel and NAP Variability Compensation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b104838d9512b53ff547ed2a2eeb4775Interactive deduplication using active learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=14140874f83bbf537107aad7223f99f0References: Improvements to the SMO algorithm for SVM regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=99369cf241bbcfe9ecadcdfa71ebd5f4
