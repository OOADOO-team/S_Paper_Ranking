name: Lagrangian Support Vector Machinesurl: http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1875836public_in: AMSauthors: Olvi L. Mangasarian,David R. Musicant,abstract: An implicit Lagrangian for the dual of a simple reformulation of the standard quadratic program of a linear support vector machine is proposed. This leads to the minimization of an unconstrained differentiable convex function in a space of dimensionality equal to the number of classified points. This problem is solvable by an extremely simple linearly convergent Lagrangian support vector machine (LSVM) algorithm. LSVM requires the inversion at the outset of a single matrix of the order of the much smaller dimensionality of the original input space plus one. The full algorithm is given in this paper in 11 lines of MATLAB code without any special optimization tools such as linear or quadratic programming solvers. This LSVM code can be used &quot;as is&quot; to solve classification problems with millions of points. For example, 2 million points in 10 dimensional input space were classified by a linear surface in 82 minutes on a Pentium III 500 MHz notebook with 384 megabytes of memory (and additional swap space), and in 7 minutes on a 250 MHz UltraSPARC II processor with 2 gigabytes of memory. Other standard classification test problems were also solved. Nonlinear kernel classification can also be solved by LSVM. Although it does not scale up to very large problems, it can handle any positive semidefinite kernel and is guaranteed to converge. A short MATLAB code is also given for nonlinear kernels and tested on a number of problems.citations_number: 880Citation: Support vector machines for classification and regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8d91624686d4111b0a46388a0030b1a6Cutting-plane training of structural SVMs http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=89d31a15aa09826faae2706f7088bfc2Core Vector Machines: Fast SVM Training on Very Large Data Sets http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e4ca8bf97ffae4df047036967ecb1de7Benchmarking Classification Models for Software Defect Prediction: A Proposed Framework and Novel Findings http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e40353bc2958e26e7aa51ab6f7c12150The diverse CB 1 and CB 2 receptor pharmacology of three plant cannabinoids: \u0394 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol and \u0394 9 -tetrahydrocannabivarin http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8c2156b91ebd73aedb87819971dca4c6A study on reduced support vector machines. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a1e038dd8e9c5a2552e29e8218277c05Learning the kernel with hyperkernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=de706d331d02561c4f4a3adce9c444d5Support vector machine-based expert system for reliable heartbeat recognition. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=73b430c04a24250e9bfef1f7cba9ebf5A Feature Selection Newton Method for Support Vector Machine Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=36eb3765e9af4e0350229ca86a717831\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u7684\u65b0\u53d1\u5c55 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8acee4bd37b89bea24b1d5581a78caacReferences: Feature Selection via Concave Minimization and Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=13389db677d1742a3b3b17fe62458122Successive overrelaxation for support vector machines. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c986a2e5dbef193c7cfbc659ee17a867Generalized Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e330f83234aac14bc9d0c972957e0eb1Nonlinear Complementarity As Unconstrained and Constrained Minimization (eng) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a63e53a287468666abc0d69ce1749816Interior-Point Methods for Massive Support Vector Machines. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=691da4cc0509b9b6f26966e4c185927eMassive data discrimination via linear support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c165b676fd85d9e1ff2875f214d7b7ecNew improved error bounds for the linear complementarity problem http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=75558e57eb8081c1507e98d45e6f26f6Handbook for matrix computations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6cdbc3cd6b6775128566cf6e6e7875c2Learning concepts from data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=edb3a9fff67df11a4fb1f589047b474aGeneralized Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=05f2bd74fcbdac9130de258fe0e6d34a
