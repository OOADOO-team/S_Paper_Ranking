name: Feature space interpretation of SVMs with indefinite kernelsurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM15794155public_in: 万方authors: HAASDONK,B,abstract: Kernel methods are becoming increasingly popular for various kinds of machine learning tasks, the most famous being the support vector machine (SVM) for classification. The SVM is well understood when using conditionally positive definite (cpd) kernel functions. However, in practice, non-cpd kernels arise and demand application in SVM. The procedure of &quot;plugging&quot; these indefinite kernels in SVM often yields good empirical classification results. However, they are hard to interpret due to missing geometrical and theoretical understanding. In this paper, we provide a step toward the comprehension of SVM classifiers in these situations. We give a geometric interpretation of SVM with indefinite kernel functions. We show that such SVM are optimal hyperplane classifiers not by margin maximization, but by minimization of distances between convex hulls in pseudo-Euclidean spaces. By this, we obtain a sound framework and motivation for indefinite SVM. This interpretation is the basis for further theoretical analysis, e.g., investigating uniqueness, and for the derivation of practical guidelines like characterizing the suitability of indefinite SVM.citations_number: 273Citation: The Dissimilarity Representation for Pattern Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5da7d2f47252e8629b7c8f3569bc4143The Dissimilarity
