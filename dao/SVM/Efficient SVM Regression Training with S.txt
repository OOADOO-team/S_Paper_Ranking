name: Efficient SVM Regression Training with SMOurl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1012474916001public_in: Springerauthors: Gary William Flake, Steve Lawrence,abstract: The sequential minimal optimization algorithm (SMO) is shown to be  an effective method for training support vector machines (SVMs) on classification tasks defined on sparse data sets. SMO differs from most SVM algorithms in that it does not require a quadratic programming solver. We generalize SMO so that it can handle regression problems. However, one problem with SMO is that its rate of convergence slows down  dramatically when data is nonsparse and when there are many support  vectors in the solution, as is often the case in regression, because  kernel function evaluations tend to dominate the runtime in this case.  Moreover. caching kernel function outputs can easily degrade SMO&#039;s  performance even more because SMO tends to access kernel function  outputs in an unstructured manner. We address these problems with  several modifications that enable caching to be effectively used with  SMO. For regression problems, our modifications improve convergence time  by over an order of magnitudecitations_number: 498Citation: Training nu-support vector regression: theory and algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cb674ef2c8eb11d0cc778d3c2c0f59a7Kernel-based reinforcement learning. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8ac5759bbaa135876349603910a9d799Kernel-Based Reinforcement Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5bf0e1f687c987439c29888812379398Fast SVM Training Algorithm with Decomposition on Very Large Data Sets http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5dec4592f24d08dcc249128944f5e68e\u7528\u4e8e\u56de\u5f52\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u65b9\u6cd5 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=33f8fb3512f17b81ad3a5bcfac78f993A note on the decomposition methods for support vector regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6bd158d6ee434d7c4470161ef8958436\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u6cd5 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dd63fa1ebcfa8dd68e48f4160e2cdfdf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9cfcac05060db32188f416bca6d5a492\u77ed\u671f\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u53d6\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=497ecddb2e08bd3b2abc1cc029d0cd70Neural Networks in a Softcomputing Framework http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ef69f0d53a6520c501d306673769dea9References: Predicting time series with support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a230caf5724a1417dd85e057481774efPredicting time series with support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e9bad9f7b1e95f02b76e6ac8369f9f04Predicting Time Series with Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4ab3e63a006db2b4e0186b394d3d87d7Improvements to the SMO algorithm for SVM regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=99369cf241bbcfe9ecadcdfa71ebd5f4Nonlinear prediction of chaotic time series using support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=83aef60916b197abb16ffb6f0fd5cbf6Successive overrelaxation for support vector machines. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c986a2e5dbef193c7cfbc659ee17a867The Kernel-Adatron Algorithm: A Fast and Simple Learning Procedure for Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fcef67189e1befbb9bdbe4df36b5b48bAn explicit algorithm for training support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=92d678586cc8ae8e536c546721eb62dbSuccessive overrelaxation for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4cf050f3218bdf5b15f8eacd0a27e6b2Nonlinear Prediction of Chaotic Time Series using a Support Vector Machine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=11c222840c972873f30a4d64cd95e3bf
