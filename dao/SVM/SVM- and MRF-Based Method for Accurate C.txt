name: SVM- and MRF-Based Method for Accurate Classification of Hyperspectral Imagesurl: http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/external-ref?access_num=10.1109/LGRS.2010.2047711&amp;link_type=DOIpublic_in: Oxford Univ Pressauthors: Tarabalka, Y., Fauvel, M., Chanussot, J.,abstract: The high number of spectral bands acquired by hyperspectral sensors increases the capability to distinguish physical materials and objects, presenting new challenges to image analysis and classification. This letter presents a novel method for accurate spectral-spatial classification of hyperspectral images. The proposed technique consists of two steps. In the first step, a probabilistic support vector machine pixelwise classification of the hyperspectral image is applied. In the second step, spatial contextual information is used for refining the classification results obtained in the first step. This is achieved by means of a Markov random field regularization. Experimental results are presented for three hyperspectral airborne images and compared with those obtained by recently proposed advanced spectral-spatial classification techniques. The proposed method improves classification accuracies when compared to other classification approaches.citations_number: 304Citation: Hyperspectral Unmixing Overview: Geometrical, Statistical, and Sparse Regression-Based Approaches http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2e4b432a5bd6d304bec05f843cfd81e4Hyperspectral Image Classification Using Dictionary-Based Sparse Representation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=35f892049c9546a82a0da1b92fcc123bHyperspectral Remote Sensing Data Analysis and Future Challenges http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=11c5767188ab4962a6f1bba1b02dc053Spectral\u2013Spatial Hyperspectral Image Segmentation Using Subspace Multinomial Logistic Regression and Markov Random Fields http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5a5059773a6be46293135a5c507f4599Hyperspectral Image Segmentation Using a New Bayesian Approach With Active Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2233088a308e326fa54994fb7c00c4f3Advances in Hyperspectral Image Classification: Earth Monitoring with Statistical Learning Methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=58f51077477a042bb0545302d3f68a73Spectral\u2013Spatial Hyperspectral Image Classification With Edge-Preserving Filtering http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=049ffb5fb6c278d77432bb6b5c8d02beA spatial\u2013spectral kernel-based approach for the classification of remote-sensing images http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6a06797f384dd6381831ece79cab534fAn overview on hyperspectral unmixing: Geometrical, statistical, and sparse regression based approaches http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=333c224dc192549c9d27f966793cdb40Enhancing Hyperspectral Image Unmixing With Spatial Correlations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6b25e51439a16356306eeef8fe4541e0References: Probability Estimates for Multi-class Classification by Pairwise Coupling http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=31ae585176690c114d87de06d8e26528Kernel-based methods for hyperspectral image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=24589a6762785157c11e460107ebf1b6Advances in Large-Margin Classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=de719fc44d5db570ea98d5a819b13b54Composite kernels for hyperspectral image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=57b13fc802b10c1fb1f28da3f74998a1Spectral and Spatial Classification of Hyperspectral Data Using SVMs and Morphological Profiles http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=45f8da7eb360ce74d3c53cf6e2486f20Classification of Multispectral Image Data by Extraction and Classification of Homogeneous Objects http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=509c3e1e671eb3b123a2dc4800d9bc82Spectral and spatial classification of hyperspectral data using SVMs and morphological profiles http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7521f1573b4a059d154211672db30fa8A Markov random field model for classification of multisource satellite imagery. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=64bb67ba3aa051565d24b1661f38fe74Segmentation and classification of hyperspectral images using watershed transformation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=acda4b7ab65aa908aab90e9bcd937359Segmentation and classification of hyperspectral images using minimum spanning forest grown from automatically selected markers. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a71fbe12ee9b35dd00a462f8676a6f28Hyperspectral Data Exploitation: Theory and Applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b38580ee6d43ff6385757df78165b976A spatial\u2013temporal approach to monitoring forest disease spread using multi-temporal high spatial resolution imagery http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1820696a027fe04d6d0ce3f2637624f2A unified framework for MAP estimation in remote sensing image segmentation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d5d2b152797a8df13a1f6af93cfd3f0Segmentation and Classification of Hyperspectral Data using Watershed. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7c2aaba70f92f2f6043bc676e8062fefA Context-Sensitive Technique Based on Support Vector Machines for Image Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1b0d0a039145accdda6d72ea54133ca7A Context-Sensitive Technique Based on Support Vector Machines for Image Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=eedf554aa40ecd7ab63f36a410765338
