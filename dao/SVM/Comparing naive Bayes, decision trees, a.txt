name: Comparing naive Bayes, decision trees, and SVM with AUC and accuracyurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/4047581_Comparing_naive_Bayes_decision_trees_and_SVM_with_AUC_and_accuracypublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: J. Huang,J. Lu,C.X. Ling,abstract: Predictive accuracy has often been used as the main and often only evaluation criterion for the predictive performance of classification or data mining algorithms. In recent years, the area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curve, or simply AUC, has been proposed as an alternative single-number measure for evaluating performance of learning algorithms. In our previous work, we proved that AUC is, in general, a better measure (defined precisely) than accuracy. Many popular data mining algorithms should then be re-evaluated in terms of AUC. For example, it is well accepted that Naive Bayes and decision trees are very similar in accuracy. How do they compare in AUC? Also, how does the recently developed SVM (Support Vector Machine) compare to traditional learning algorithms in accuracy and AUC? We will answer these questions in this paper. Our conclusions will provide important guide-lines in data mining applications on real-world datasets.citations_number: 169Citation: Using AUC and Accuracy in Evaluating Learning Algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b5fafe87f8712b1fecaeb8940aafe27An experimental comparison of performance measures for classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ea1de747d2f3358d04e8a32617eaf643Feature selection and the class imbalance problem in predicting protein function from sequence. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d538d48f99ebd4693fb4414191dd4152\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e0e\u7c97\u7cd9\u96c6\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7efc\u5408\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fdc09b2c1a9d9512d8088c064aace24d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7f51\u7edc\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7efc\u5408\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=745338c574af2f834850b02a4bf48f8c\u57fa\u4e8eRough Set\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u6734\u7d20\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=55aca9ef205971f97f43cd2c710bc91e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\u71b5\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5f0f\u6734\u7d20\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5206\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4611ddca85068c19db25ede1e8c483a2Inductive Intrusion Detection in Flow-Based Network Data Using One-Class Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fa05a5ab109fab2ac3d358a177fe19baSemi-supervised self-training for sentence subjectivity classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=177e457fc643b45ec879af1e2b68c8a9Learning k -Nearest Neighbor Naive Bayes for Ranking http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2ebd20b82ba896d03c5572b590473ff7References: Benchmarking Least Squares Support Vector Machine Classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f3624e73e75bd085cbfb1a2473fc8604An analysis of Bayesian classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7ecb76ca85b98bffc44cd946589ed4e4The Case Against Accuracy Estimation for Comparing Induction Algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0a1ef6ec58b8f9b66c00cf876964ecddAnalysis and visualization of classifier performance: comparison under imprecise class and cost distributions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=15885d463e032055c994187f56f7b569Discretization: An Enabling Technique http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=667c3976ca48d03c8d0badbec86cb9bdTree Induction for Probability-Based Ranking http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=556efcb5655da80abfa8ed93be7c3baeLearning Decision Trees Using the Area Under the ROC Curve. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3fe4626fef72572f9018e0b5a8731c0fDecision, estimation, and classification:an introduction to pattern recognition and related topics http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8c12c76367ffec29588cb95d68fca639AUC: a statistically consistent and more discriminating measure than accuracy http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4f97f1276b82b2ab75c00f9fbea94b60Support Vector Machines and the Bayes Rule in Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5505c5ce82ef12d518b3a0429322c1f8Retrofitting Decision Tree Classifiers Using Kernel Density Estimation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=60c1f7b15ecacba0a46340cfd61ee18aToward Bayesian Classifiers with Accurate Probabilities http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cb25ed06a113b7c6b1e7e30e0f48314aCurrent Trends In Knowledge Acquisition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c66d8e04b8c58c2be856616cb7f5a692Tree Induction for Probability-Based Ranking http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1963f805fc6b4cc71e2c354e48d078e1Retrofitting decision tree classifiers using kernel density estimation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b5092a0892bb559d12705876f6ed89cdToward Bayesian Classifiers with Accurate Probabilities http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b30f0bfa00da6091abe0db7ab55a448Toward Bayesian Classifiers with Accurate Probabilities http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8a9283521c103d62c3a719d44bad564aCurrent trends in knowledge acquisition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=24778fc78df63779c777c79ac21353cf
