name: A formal analysis of stopping criteria of decomposition methods for support vector machinesurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM18244502public_in: 万方authors: Lin, ChihJen,abstract: In a previous paper, the author (2001) proved the convergence of a commonly used decomposition method for support vector machines (SVMs). However, there is no theoretical justification about its stopping criterion, which is based on the gap of the violation of the optimality condition. It is essential to have the gap asymptotically approach zero, so we are sure that existing implementations stop in a finite number of iterations after reaching a specified tolerance. Here, we prove this result and illustrate it by two extensions: ν-SVM and a multiclass SVM by Crammer and Singer (2001). A further result shows that, in final iterations of the decomposition method, only a particular set of variables are still being modified. This supports the use of the shrinking and caching techniques in some existing implementations. Finally, we prove the asymptotic convergence of a decomposition method for this multiclass SVM. Discussions on the difference between this convergence proof and the one in another paper by Lin are also included.citations_number: 177Citation: LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b1552ffd60e8a942090f6dfadd26687LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=309e25e4e7d5ca5cbe656208c220a1afA comparison of methods for multiclass support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b9cd4bfb4d07c34b416308b85ebf97a1A Comparison of Methods for Multiclass Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1be26f8d6e2f32156cda4d10c6807e66Working Set Selection Using Second Order Information for Training Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f5b8426229b0f88f7d2cd0b1273d29efA Simple Decomposition Method for Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=543acfb0eb85926c82bcaede66403d8fA study on SMO-type decomposition methods for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d331505cb1ed870f8f70c1d1f80e13feA study on SMO-type decomposition methods for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=588e1670bef83f079f22e635addc0443Asymptotic convergence of an SMO algorithm without any assumptions. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a7d7c193fbba155956e950a439e4f299A digital architecture for support vector machines: theory, algorithm, and FPGA implementation. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b553066f6060a37fc607eddcd5c9b847References: Training Support Vector Machines: an Application to Face Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a695bfc73b605e2cc76745541a626a3cNew support vector algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3d26c7b685bc5ac5e82b6f03992a6b74On the algorithmic implementation of multiclass kernel-based vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b47acd19b1fd48eebecffeb19e54274fTraining nu-support vector classifiers: theory and algorithms. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=90fee87b0e49c3cc69450c19dc671860Convergence of a generalized SMO algorithm for SVM classifier design http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3c1b1c00382cde1feccf43d64c2c6c30On the convergence of the decomposition method for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ebac281a793039df68c1635c8184b7a3Training nu-support vector regression: theory and algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cb674ef2c8eb11d0cc778d3c2c0f59a7Convergence of a Generalized SMO Algorithm for SVM Classifier Design http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=079e529b3f35a1bfe6cb88b8718d33caDeleted DOI - Crossref http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d17e2fe6a2d8c9d6825a9832eb168b0Asymptotic convergence of an SMO algorithm without any assumptions. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a7d7c193fbba155956e950a439e4f299A note on the decomposition methods for support vector regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6bd158d6ee434d7c4470161ef8958436A formal analysis of stopping criteria of decomposition methods for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=063fd88cbf6614b699fd6b8b776bf13eAsymptotic convergence of an SMO algorithm without any assumptions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=094b0127a70e2f5ffa47c7f693e2dd57Training support vector machines: an application to face detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8b4bfbea140449d9778dfbc1eb4187e0On the algorithmic implementation of multiclass kernel-based vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a08f2b97b6d527cb618c83e7c67aeddb
