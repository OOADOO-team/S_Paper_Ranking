name: Weighted least squares support vector machines: robustness and sparse approximationurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231201006440public_in: Elsevierauthors: J.A.K. Suykens, J. De Brabanter, L. Lukas,abstract: Least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) is an SVM version  which involves equality instead of inequality constraints and works with  a least squares cost function. In this way, the solution follows from a linear Karush-Kuhn-Tucker system instead of a quadratic programming problem. However, sparseness is lost in the LS-SVM case and the estimation of the support values is only optimal in the case of a Gaussian distribution of the error variables. In this paper, we discuss a method which can overcome these two drawbacks. We show how to obtain robust estimates for regression by applying a weighted version of LS-SVM. We also discuss a sparse approximation procedure for weighted and unweighted LS-SVM. It is basically a pruning method which is able to  do pruning based upon the physical meaning of the sorted support values,  while pruning procedures for classical multilayer perceptrons require  the computation of a Hessian matrix or its inverse. The methods of this  paper are illustrated for RBF kernels and demonstrate how to obtain  robust estimates with selection of an appropriate number of hidden  units, in the case of outliers or non-Gaussian error distributions with  heavy tailscitations_number: 1599Citation: Kernel-based reinforcement learning. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8ac5759bbaa135876349603910a9d799Advanced support vector machines and kernel methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=732c14b474e665b319689947e39b4c40Kernel-Based Reinforcement Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5bf0e1f687c987439c29888812379398\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u65b9\u6cd5 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b43e177539be43598a5213b47116626eFast exact leave-one-out cross-validation of sparse least-squares support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d6208e67c2880ca2a35ca10939103b0d\u7528\u4e8e\u56de\u5f52\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u65b9\u6cd5 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=33f8fb3512f17b81ad3a5bcfac78f993Financial time series forecasting using independent component analysis and support vector regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=12b8366ebe7b307109643d19e68f4a20Methodology for long-term prediction of time series http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e86db6d84e63b1828a160cf6699d6a77Mutual information for the selection of relevant variables in spectrometric nonlinear modelling \u2606 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6ccfb6bd1bea40c8baa1905543f0c95aRobust support vector regression networks for function approximation with outliers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6b67d79db555f98f332b6c7bf20aa980References: Distributions in statistics.
