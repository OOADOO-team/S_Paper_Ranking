name: A novel SVM-based hysteresis current controllerurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/3279704_A_novel_SVM-based_hysteresis_current_controllerpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Bong-Hwan Kwon, , Tae-Woo Kim, , Jang-Hyoun Youm,,abstract: In this paper, a novel space vector modulation (SVM)-based  hysteresis current controller (HCC) for squirrel cage induction motors  is proposed. This technique utilizes all advantages of the HCC and SVM technique. The controller determines a set of space vectors from a region detector and applies a space vector selected according to the main HCC. A set of space vectors including the zero vector to reduce the  number of switchings is determined from the sign of the output frequency  and output signals of three comparators with a little larger hysteresis  band than that of the main HCC. A simple hardware implementation is  proposed and experimental results of the SVM-based HCC are also showncitations_number: 242Citation: Current control techniques for three-phase voltage-source PWM converters: a survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1f2b00c11089461d22b6f68d6bbeac3dPWM\u6574\u6d41\u5668\u53ca\u5176\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7814\u7a76 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e7c63a159dc1fdffb2bd05cf09e6ba66An Improved Deadbeat Current Control Scheme With a Novel Adaptive Self-Tuning Load Model for a Three-Phase PWM Voltage-Source Inverter http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4dcaf11716ad67d7e7caa53bf4f6ae9f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u538b\u7a7a\u95f4\u77e2\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u6e90\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u6ede\u73af\u7535\u6d41\u63a7\u5236\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c8926411a6d52f1c5834c6e77b786a8c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u7535\u538b\u77e2\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u6e90\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u7535\u6d41\u63a7\u5236\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=53ef41fea10e99c867790cdb3640507fA Single Synchronous Frame Hybrid (SSFH) Multifrequency Controller for Power Active Filters http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b98976e42345dade83ff5ea9578fcccbDirect current control-a new current regulation principle http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7a70dfec13621ddc50fdac661a80ea43A New Vector-Based Hysteresis Current Control Scheme for Three-Phase PWM Voltage-Source Inverters http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6765704058d69f8de184e9c8e47183d8Enhanced Hysteresis-Based Current Regulators in Vector Control of DFIG Wind Turbines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3bee3e8050d8212e207f74f4c402754dControl Strategy for Series and Parallel Output Dual-Buck Half Bridge Inverters Based on DSP Control http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d00c9c168ffa3617ef77ab359359c09bReferences: Current Control of VSI-PWM Inverters http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5b92dcf98f43986dd10eac5d40601d09A Novel Control Scheme for Current-Controlled PWM Inverters http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bfe7d3061144bc4304b650425eab0441An adaptive hysteresis-band current control technique of a voltage-fed PWM inverter for machine drive system http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=32555253bee6b5ef0784f6192d0dc3e6A novel hysteresis control method for current-controlled voltage-source PWM inverters with constant modulation frequency http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b6557a73827f74a3aa704096da6ea0acA novel control scheme of a parallel current-controlled PWM inverter http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7d076b5ebd665356f22777ca7f6ca3a6Recent advances in power electronics http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fb24a8c4394bd08828ac2db30c8ff1a4Novel space vector based current controllers for PWM-inverters http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=818f47a63c303a349e98ceb182325f25Design and Experimental Results of a Brushless AC Servo Drive http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b938d1cf0bc7da39434366ed0db9ec8An improved hysteresis current controller for reducing switching frequency http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b0fe197a76c94c4d132253c93cca99e2Recent progress in the development in solid-state AC motor drives http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3c17e4cd260bc19d24d76e5fb09766feRecent advances in power electronics http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=45ebcb81533aecf2e72af3523ce1ae26A novel vector control scheme for transistor PWM inverter-fed induction motor drive http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=450121091bdae96dbba91dd2b4f4b9d2A fully software-controlled PWM rectifier with current link http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e6542281bf0b782c2f97896fb148ec68PWM technique for inverter with sinusoidal output current http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6dd940fd7278794c74ec24e7da42ed57PWM technique for inverter with sinusoidal output current http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9f1e9c1a2e4e314c81d68f780637c1c5Field-oriented asynchronous pulsewidth modulation for high performance AC machine drives operating at low switching frequency http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bf92353617f5a0c80aeba19674630eedField-oriented asynchronous pulse-width modulation for high-performance AC machine drives operating at low switching frequency http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a0dbe9dddb7b82f06d2878044ffc840fA novel vector control scheme for transistor PWM inverter http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c2691c9f19275a2c4717f0b3f20468c3
