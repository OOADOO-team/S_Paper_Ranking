name: Binary tree of SVM: a new fast multiclass training and classification algorithmurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM16722173public_in: 万方authors: Ben, Fei,Jinbai, Liu,abstract: We present a new architecture named Binary Tree of support vector machine (SVM), or BTS, in order to achieve high classification efficiency for multiclass problems. BTS and its enhanced version, c-BTS, decrease the number of binary classifiers to the greatest extent without increasing the complexity of the original problem. In the training phase, BTS has N-1 binary classifiers in the best situation (N is the number of classes), while it has log4/3((N+3)/4) binary tests on average when making a decision. At the same time the upper bound of convergence complexity is determined. The experiments in this paper indicate that maintaining comparable accuracy, BTS is much faster to be trained than other methods. Especially in classification, due to its Log complexity, it is much faster than directed acyclic graph SVM (DAGSVM) and ECOC in problems that have big class numbercitations_number: 284Citation: An overview of ensemble methods for binary classifiers in multi-class problems: Experimental study on one-vs-one and one-vs-all schemes. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=23cefd16f7df2983ede1c77988dcdee6A multi-class SVM classifier utilizing binary decision tree http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8a613305750473cc9ee38fd4300cc217SVM-Based Fuzzy Decision Trees for Classification of High Spatial Resolution Remote Sensing Images http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4ab1ca7f484d91956e52d335915f299fMulticlass Posterior Probability Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=06bafd9ff337503fde6d7aa0dc2f2ff5Inferring users' online activities through traffic analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1ce0ef2fbf2908e79d38af18be0873daUsing Stacked Generalization to Combine SVMs in Magnitude and Shape Feature Spaces for Classification of Hyperspectral Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=272f2232998f455d80dc4f7e5a15f2caAdaptive Classification for Hyperspectral Image Data Using Manifold Regularization Kernel Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a973da00309a046b850c27f91653475cA comparison study on multiple binary-class SVM methods for unilabel text categorization. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e7c3627cea92e89ac58f3861b253ab27Reduced one-against-all method for multiclass SVM classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cbcc58092e8d96dd82509b1ca0dd48ecLetters: Adaptive binary tree for fast SVM multiclass classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c1b20b2818a9e5d5cafec98f41136d38References: Textures: A Photographic Album for Artists and Designers by Phil Brodatz (review) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e9a55112ce60bed92313e71edf50db14Solving multiclass learning problems via error-correcting output codes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5649a10d6c89169efddfa84b161b7e5cOn the algorithmic implementation of multiclass kernel-based vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b47acd19b1fd48eebecffeb19e54274fClassification by Pairwise Coupling http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=619dd64d0e846ccc2d7d1dad4236c247On the Learnability and Design of Output Codes for Multiclass Problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c60bb2062862f38758df8593e46d4813Support vector machines, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, and randomized GACV http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=52c27628d2ddbe96ee46705625c324a7Convergence of a generalized SMO algorithm for SVM classifier design http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3c1b1c00382cde1feccf43d64c2c6c30Deleted DOI - Crossref http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d17e2fe6a2d8c9d6825a9832eb168b0Incremental training of support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0172fec3ef69b2def580d440a75edcfdNew results on error correcting output codes of kernel machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=db2721502a8481d0a59a874a8edfe44eRigorous proof of termination of SMO algorithm for support vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6232e0d47dbd420973157fa17b389038Texture classification using wavelet scale relationships http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9d92c7b12f136c65222281309f93593eOn the algorithmic implementation of multiclass kernel-based vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a08f2b97b6d527cb618c83e7c67aeddbClassification by pairwise coupling http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f77ecf82837ec7cab1020932069cd34eSolving multiclass learning problems via error-correcting output codes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9cf1c1fb919fb38038ba694fc993afad
