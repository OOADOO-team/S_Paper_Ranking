K,abstract: Abstract In this paper we apply a recently proposed technique of optimal control by support vector machines (SVMs) to chaos control. Vapnik&#039;s support vector method, which is based on the structural risk minimization principle and has been very successful in classification and function estimation problems, is embedded within the context of the N -stage optimal control problem. State vector tracking is considered by a state feedback controller which is parameterized by SVMs. Mercer&#039;s condition, an essential feature in SVMs, is applicable within the optimal control problem formulation. Simulation examples are given for chaos control of the Henon map to a period-1 orbit by means of a SVM controller with radial basis function kernel.
