name: Simple Direct Power Control of Three-Phase PWM Rectifier Using Space Vector Modulation â€“ A Comparative Studyurl: http://www.emeraldinsight.com/servlet/linkout?suffix=frd3&amp;dbid=16&amp;doi=10.1108%2F03321641111091601&amp;key=10.1109%2FTIE.2004.825278public_in: Emeraldauthors: Mariusz Malinowski,Marian Kazmierkowski,abstract: This paper describes control techniques for PWM rectifiers. In particular, the so-called virtual-flux oriented control (VFOC) and virtual-flux based direct power control (VF-DPC) schemes are described and compared with their voltage based counterparts, that is, the voltage oriented control (VOC) and voltage-based direct power control (DPC) techniques. Theoretical background is provided, and results of computer simulations are given, documenting advantages and disadvantages of the individual control strategies. Moreover, paper proposes a novel and simple direct power control of three-phase PWM rectifiers with constant switching frequency using space vector modulation (DPC-SVM), which combines VFOC with VF-DPC. The steady state and dynamic results of DPC-SVM that illustrate the operation and performance of the proposed system are presented. It is shown that DPC-SVM exhibits several positive features as: simple algorithm, good dynamic response, constant switching frequency and particularly provide sinusoidal line current when supply voltage is no ideal. Results have proven excellent performances and verify the validity of the proposed system.citations_number: 696Citation: Simple Direct Power Control of Three-Phase PWM Rectifier Using Space Vector Modulation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 A Comparative Study http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6a467d324d83302617941084d971bd50A review of power converter topologies for wind generators http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3e941a0a987ed8701ca3845bc3989c1aThe active NPC converter and its loss-balancing control http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9d95359532eb798f339112121580634fA Modified Direct Power Control Strategy Allowing the Connection of Three-Phase Inverters to the Grid Through $LCL$ Filters http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=23940cbd4c2cb5ec4e9e38e272f2f56cImproved Control of DFIG Systems During Network Unbalance Using PI\u2013R Current Regulators http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4aad7faa907903c52d175a7c6cc71016\u76f4\u9a71\u578b\u98ce\u529b\u53d1\u7535\u7cfb\u7edf\u5168\u529f\u7387\u5e76\u7f51\u53d8\u6d41\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7814\u7a76 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=96f91b1d35977f36cacb6ee9e92edabdA Simple Voltage Sensorless Active Damping Scheme for Three-Phase PWM Converters With an $LCL$ Filter http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1bdb7d39340ca1938ba03953ad071b41Frequency Response Analysis of Current Controllers for Selective Harmonic Compensation in Active Power Filters http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=105dc025709250efecbd82a579d49020Direct Power Control of an AFE Using Predictive Control http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0cce38fc27ebba2cab7afcd3f8312cc9Predictive Direct Power Control of Three-Phase Pulsewidth Modulation (PWM) Rectifier Using Space-Vector Modulation (SVM) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=87ef8783d751d12c89adee1cfa5c54f3References: Current control techniques for three-phase voltage-source PWM converters: a survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1f2b00c11089461d22b6f68d6bbeac3dDirect power control of PWM converter without power-source voltage sensors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bf992587eb06450f37127b5e5eecf6ceDual current control scheme for PWM converter under unbalanced input voltage conditions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a00f91fb29b369bef171ccc87053fadcVirtual-flux-based direct power control of three-phase PWM rectifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=74c7ef882dfbe44acae1aa7979112e47Simple Direct Power Control of Three-Phase PWM Rectifier Using Space Vector Modulation \u00e2\u0080\u0093 A Comparative Study http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6a467d324d83302617941084d971bd50Three phase PWM converter\/inverter by means of instantaneous active and reactive power control http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fbb7758e4a55a424125228110b5a3ac7Mitigation of voltage dips through distributed generation systems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8646837b2807ed1146ee6b312ea8b157A line-voltage-sensorless synchronous rectifier http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3edff938748414fb872ab52bd290ffd1Reference frames fit for controlling PWM rectifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2140c0c71250956041eeae99c3ed1abaDigital harmonic acquisition with delay time compensation based on the improved d-q transformation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b7c7c41694a7f4201346cc8bb77e758eMitigation of voltage dips through distributed generation systems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=eb7f74430df28170851711a43473c454
