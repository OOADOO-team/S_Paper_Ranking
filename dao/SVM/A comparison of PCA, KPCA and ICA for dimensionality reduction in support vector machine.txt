name: A comparison of PCA, KPCA and ICA for dimensionality reduction in support vector machineurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231203004338public_in: Elsevierauthors: L.J. Cao, K.S. Chua, W.K. Chong,abstract: Recently, support vector machine (SVM) has become a popular tool  in time series forecasting. In developing a successful SVM forecastor, the first step is feature extraction. This paper proposes the applications of principal component analysis (PCA), kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) to SVM for feature extraction. PCA linearly transforms the original inputs into new uncorrelated features. KPCA is a nonlinear PCA developed by using the kernel method. In ICA, the original inputs are linearly transformed into features which are mutually statistically independent. By examining the sunspot data, Santa Fe data set A and five real futures  contracts, the experiments shows that SVM by feature extraction using  PCA, KPCA or ICA can perform better than that without feature  extraction. Furthermore, among the three methods, there is the best  performance in KPCA feature extraction, followed by ICA feature extractioncitations_number: 469Citation: Application of nonlinear feature
