name: Recurrent least squares support vector machinesurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2370080_Recurrent_Least_Squares_Support_Vector_Machinespublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Suykens, J.A.K., Vandewalle, J.,abstract: The method of support vector machines (SVM&#039;s) has been developed  for solving classification and static function approximation problems.  In this paper we introduce SVM&#039;s within the context of recurrent neural networks. Instead of Vapnik&#039;s epsilon insensitive loss function, we consider a least squares version related to a cost function with equality constraints for a recurrent network. Essential features of SVM&#039;s remain, such as Mercer&#039;s condition and the fact that the output weights are a Lagrange multiplier weighted sum of the data points. The solution to recurrent least squares (LS-SVM&#039;s) is characterized by a set  of nonlinear equations. Due to its high computational complexity, we  focus on a limited case of assigning the squared error an infinitely  large penalty factor with early stopping as a form of regularization.  The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on trajectory learning  of the double scroll attractor in Chua&#039;s circuitcitations_number: 466Citation: Financial time series prediction using least squares support vector machines within the evidence framework. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ece847161a8280c50cfdb8077251339eSupport Vector Machines: A Nonlinear Modelling and Control Perspective * http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fac43c6d7a8ca4b3a151a9ee5271fa0bTraining recurrent networks by Evolino. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b7af7b88a6d857b02f7dc1b7c0bd246cColor image watermark extraction based on support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d8a9bc6646e749bc7189158d105bb6b7Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6: Evidence for a strong founder effect among German families http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=386e74850541d535dfccaa561d3f1817\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u7684\u7535\u7ad9\u9505\u7089\u71c3\u70e7\u4f18\u5316 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ab7ce24faf18ec490f88a0b58140478eA forecasting and forewarning model for methane hazard in working face of coal mine based on LS-SVM http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8590f00edd5df481d95efbede87bf44eSmall infrared target fusion detection based on support vector machines in the wavelet domain http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c6c140d07be2d822ac0ecfd789be351aShort-Term Load Forecasting Based on Least Squares Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f5de3967d59c36e23b822c696858c856\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0a57f300e0a22c0dd54df92898b2394eReferences: Networks for approximation and learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3798e3238147fc0db5c6081e7431ec41Backpropagation Through Time: What It Does and How to Do It http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bde6c9b08f8dfd66a324b6895186fa26Introduction to artificial neural systems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dc172227938a972f57272d5dea9682c9Comparing Support Vector Machines with Gaussian Kernels to Radial Basis Function Classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=aebd67933e2ab7a3926a004c60680351The double scroll family http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bd7e41a7c304b3e2c3a6d6b4397434c9On the \"Identification and control of dynamical systems using neural networks\" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0f472c722a3e96ce13c728d2297882adNonlinear black-box modeling in system identification: a unified overview http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=388ee2f6f42374ad2c51d49453e786f4The connection between regularization operators and support vector kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=05ab68cdab9948b35c1761eaf7244a91Ridge Regression Learning Algorithm in Dual Variables http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=05ac432f97c520153327a186fc1c022bChua's Circuit: A Paradigm for Chaos http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d3e42191c8973bd090e9bd041fda864fOn a Kernel-Based Method for Pattern Recognition, Regression, Approximation, and Operator Inversion http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8679ba3733278bba99a809e8f57263d5Gradient methods for the optimisation of dynamical systems containing neural networks http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=410dbf66e3ab4842b61d5d28b6de4bb4The Support Vector Method of Function Estimation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e0c7b83b077c00cc462e629463b248b2Support Vector Machines: A Nonlinear Modelling and Control Perspective * http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fac43c6d7a8ca4b3a151a9ee5271fa0bLearning from data : concepts, theory, and methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f183c3a12d8b4621684d5cb2dc8c1421CHUA\u2019S CIRCUIT: AN OVERVIEW TEN YEARS LATER http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6bf7b846165d176fc3ecb5a6c6532395Nonlinear Modeling: advanced black-box techniques http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9dca5cdac951b6f4665e02b46ab33197Learning a simple recurrent neural state space model to behave like Chua's double scroll http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=14a8a59c2b298528d6631051671374d7Nonlinear Modeling http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=01c79224864042a9e8514235c474f541
