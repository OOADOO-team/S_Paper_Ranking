name: On-line Handwriting Recognition with Support Vector Machines-A Kernel Approachurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2537970_On-line_Handwriting_Recognition_with_Support_Vector_Machines-A_Kernel_Approachpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Claus Bahlmann,Bernard Haasdonk,Hans Burkhardt,abstract: In this contribution we describe a novel classification approach for on-line handwriting recognition. The technique combines dynamic time warping (DTW) and support vector machines (SVMs) by establishing a new SVM kernel. We call this kernel Gaussian DTW (GDTW) kernel. This kernel approach has a main advantage over common HMM techniques. It does not assume a model for the generative class conditional densities. Instead, it directly addresses the problem of discrimination by creating class boundaries and thus is less sensitive to modeling assumptions. By incorporating DTW in the kernel function, general classification problems with variable-sized sequential data can be handled. In this respect the proposed method can be straightforwardly applied to all classification problems, where DTW gives a reasonable distance measure, e.g. speech recognition or genome processing. We show experiments with this kernel approach on the UNIPEN handwriting data, achieving results comparable to an HMM-based technique.citations_number: 437Citation: Improving SVM accuracy by training on auxiliary data sources http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9f933afa2ac636e58e1ea529569e4fd6A SURVEY ON PATTERN RECOGNITION APPLICATIONS OF SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0de3cc6e23ebf6e7e34a2cd4d89b3d72Feature Space Interpretation of SVMs with Indefinite Kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e97c433c75369033f60cc438d683329cImproving SVM accuracy by training on auxiliary data sources http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=789092f5c8b6fc5af8d06582d5dd4b42Feature space interpretation of SVMs with indefinite kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3223ee943974b796fe335320ca7d40eeA Novel Connectionist System for Unconstrained Handwriting Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=83fe7ffe9f88dbbb5d89851729059a76The Writer Independent Online Handwriting Recognition System frog on hand and Cluster Generative Statistical Dynamic Time Warping http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bc02fbdef5a2a81489889ef7fc80fb6fThe writer independent online handwriting recognition system frog on hand and cluster generative statistical dynamic time warping. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5ec932749998ebc91e686fbeee241ce8A Kernel for Time Series Based on Global Alignments http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f8ca71dbc9621a3b864b0c513ed6aae3Sign language recognition by combining statistical DTW and independent classification. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=21f50611b34ac001f5e99ca199d926b3References: Input Space Versus Feature Space in Kernel-Based Methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=edd0273817621c00de6cfe949e4f9cccTraining Invariant Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=832ea83656111399cb0933511e6bd8ecUsing the Fisher kernel method to detect remote protein homologies. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9c286bb2091a086d7a3666244c35d867UNIPEN project of on-line data exchange and recognizer benchmarks http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=edb577936f7bd11dc4a45103d277e781Cursive script recognition by elastic matching http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e45817da0fba573eec7bfd52acfd1834Tangent distance kernels for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4717692242f7ca4951bbc3bec0b59bafWriter independent on-line handwriting recognition using an HMM approach http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f0b10858a6434fadb4edbc0631685d1bTangent Distance Kernels for Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=34bfb1210750e53233d67312ee28e4eeMeasuring HMM Similarity with the Bayes Probability of Error and its Application to Online Handwriting Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c93b41d36e92923c921e90a43a4e61acCharacter recognition experiments using Unipen data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0f1181f53a77c0cc2731efa2fa9f613cStrategies for Combining On-line and Off-line Information in an On-line Handwriting Recognition System http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b71a8e958953df829b3b74f015e00e2fStrategies for Combining On-line and Off-line Information in an On-line Handwriting Recognition System http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=af408d59572c3defc4ee8ba2e5c0c761Dynamic Alignment Kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fbba6fe4d242293a4092f730a2fe2440
