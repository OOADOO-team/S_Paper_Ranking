name: Tumor classification by partial least squares using microarray gene expression dataurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_JJ023799192public_in: 万方authors: Nguyen, D. V., Rocke, D. M.,abstract: Motivation: One important application of gene expression microarray data is classification of samples into categories, such as the type of tumor. The use of microarrays allows simultaneous monitoring of thousands of genes expressions per sample. This ability to measure gene expression en masse has resulted in data with the number of variables p (genes) far exceeding the number of samples N. Standard statistical methodologies in classification and prediction do not work well or even at all when N &lt; p. Modification of existing statistical methodologies or development of new methodologies is needed for the analysis of microarray data. Results: We propose a novel analysis procedure for classifying (predicting) human tumor samples based on microarray gene expressions. This procedure involves dimension reduction using Partial Least Squares (PLS) and classification using Logistic Discrimination (LD) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA). We compare PLS to the well known dimension reduction method of Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Under many circumstances PLS proves superior; we illustrate a condition when PCA particularly fails to predict well relative to PLS. The proposed methods were applied to five different microarray data sets involving various human tumor samples: (1) normal versus ovarian tumor; (2) Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) versus Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL); (3) Diff use Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCLL) versus B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (BCLL); (4) normal versus colon tumor; and (5) Non-Small-Cell-Lung-Carcinoma (NSCLC) versus renal samples. Stability of classification results and methods were further assessed by re-randomization studies.citations_number: 1389Citation: Gene Selection for Cancer Classification using Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8854f0c7f668ca96b4ea79e580d025b0Feature selection based on mutual information criteria of max-dependency, max-relevance, and min-redundancy http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8b30e86867c54cac845e887de686f7a7Comparison of Discrimination Methods for the Classification of Tumors Using Gene Expression Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a884581d574ee415a52e455724960a2eGene expression correlates of clinical prostate cancer behavior. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7078aae851cd2cdfb51b7d7250f78f8fA review of feature selection techniques in bioinformatics http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4431ccbc76ca38c050a5ba3161e7508dClassification, subtype discovery, and prediction of outcome in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia by gene expression profiling. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d253d7a878e93d07db8fbb044a5ccaeeA Model-Based Background Adjustment for Oligonucleotide Expression Arrays http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=05f6fd9ab1ddbca1faf8162fd6bcea53Statistical methods for identifying differentially expressed genes in replicated cDNA microarray experiments.
