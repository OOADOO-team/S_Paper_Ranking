name: Fusion of Heterogeneous Speaker Recognition Systems in the STBU Submission for the NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation 2006url: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/3457895_Fusion_of_Heterogeneous_Speaker_Recognition_Systems_in_the_STBU_Submission_for_the_NIST_Speaker_Recognition_Evaluation_2006public_in: ResearchGateauthors: Brummer, N., Burget, L., Cernocky, J.H.,abstract: This paper describes and discusses the &quot;STBU&quot; speaker recognition system, which performed well in the NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation 2006 (SRE). STBU is a consortium of four partners: Spescom DataVoice (Stellenbosch, South Africa), TNO (Soesterberg, The Netherlands), BUT (Brno, Czech Republic), and the University of Stellenbosch (Stellenbosch, South Africa). The STBU system was a combination of three main kinds of subsystems: 1) GMM, with short-time Mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) or perceptual linear prediction (PLP) features, 2) Gaussian mixture model-support vector machine (GMM-SVM), using GMM mean supervectors as input to an SVM, and 3) maximum-likelihood linear regression-support vector machine (MLLR-SVM), using MLLR speaker adaptation coefficients derived from an English large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) system. All subsystems made use of supervector subspace channel compensation methods-either eigenchannel adaptation or nuisance attribute projection. We document the design and performance of all subsystems, as well as their fusion and calibration via logistic regression. Finally, we also present a cross-site fusion that was done with several additional systems from other NIST SRE-2006 participants.citations_number: 243Citation: An overview of text-independent speaker recognition: From features to supervectors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=42062a3b66eaea144ad291d329a25784A Study of Interspeaker Variability in Speaker Verification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b17205ff8f4c66ab604120c7e1434502A study of inter-speaker variability in speaker verification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=385ab9d816cca19a3d502e16c49c5c7fAnalysis of Feature Extraction and Channel Compensation in a GMM Speaker Recognition System http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b00bac4e31df982f70adfcd14a9c99fdComparison of scoring methods used in speaker recognition with Joint Factor Analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=405af8a5fe78e42503440f5c73e8bdd4Comparison of scoring methods used in speaker recognition with Joint Factor Analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c028f63cd309f135f10ff06abe0215e8Spoofing and countermeasures for speaker verification: A survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1d5e0bb080e8e2be1ea82607014e5fbdSimplification and optimization of i-vector extraction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=387472735289aabdbd974db155f4b35aDiscriminatively trained Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis for speaker verification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=61ed66f8fcbca3e6aa16a38c3f50cb8bSimplification and optimization of i-vector extraction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=620834f32fcd0e412f5c22749aacaebfReferences: Score Normalization for Text-Independent Speaker Verification Systems. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b1fda75152d2cfa3d465e80ee17261d1Support vector machines using GMM supervectors for speaker verification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8d8ec04ebacbf78b890c0d9a95852ea7Score Normalization for Text-Independent Speaker Verification Systems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a0ac2c88399035acee5df4417964bab8SVM Based Speaker Verification using a GMM Supervector Kernel and NAP Variability Compensation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b104838d9512b53ff547ed2a2eeb4775Joint Factor Analysis Versus Eigenchannels in Speaker Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b2a55b9f1ac1190077e4066cdbbb6385The NIST speaker recognition evaluation \u2013 Overview, methodology, systems, results, perspective http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e72ef44ecd88668d77b6087513701202Application-independent evaluation of speaker detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=01bb22c56125cfd8d8a266a8be669abcChannel robust speaker verification via feature mapping http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=705433d9a6a51affd1b184d15c2b7304Channel robust speaker verification via feature mapping http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9237eb195726d4f09dc574b2d4952148Speaker and session variability in GMM-based speaker verification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3bd3848f7a0ebaff15b45befb429b79cAdvances In Channel Compensation For SVM Speaker Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=03c3bb78e297fa077219ef94aec57b89Generalized linear discriminant sequence kernels for speaker recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=72155ed9a837217e8eee9a54fe73c231The AMI System for the Transcription of Speech in Meetings http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=10eee56efab275f406b36a71858d639bThe 2005 AMI System for the Transcription of Speech in Meetings http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3534fd3c9d4712c59098b25c53674dbdAnalysis of Feature Extraction and Channel Compensation in a GMM Speaker Recognition System http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b00bac4e31df982f70adfcd14a9c99fdNIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation Chronicles -
