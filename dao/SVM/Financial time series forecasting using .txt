name: Financial time series forecasting using support vector machinesurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231203003722public_in: Elsevierauthors: Kyoung-jae Kim,abstract: Support vector machines (SVM) are promising methods for the  prediction of financial time-series because the use a risk function  consisting of the empirical error and a regularized term which is  derived from the structural risk minimization principle. This study  applies SVM to predicting the stock price index. In addition, this study  examines the feasibility of applying SVM in financial forecasting by  comparing it with back-propagation neural networks and case-based  reasoning. The experimental results show that SVM provides a promising  alternative to stock market predictioncitations_number: 1146Citation: Bankruptcy prediction using support vector machine with optimal choice of kernel function parameters http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=46fe42ff5eec4b4d5fcee9dd76a1c404An application of support vector machines in bankruptcy prediction model. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c0695080324b5fe2fc514207e5aa8aa1Time Series Prediction Using Support Vector Machines: A Survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a79927ed51624eac3b0064835efa47c6Hybrid genetic algorithms and support vector machines for bankruptcy prediction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f5eac0c57a5abf345c9fca72c3a8095cA real-valued genetic algorithm to optimize the parameters of support vector machine for predicting bankruptcy http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6c75b8d766d6acc46da5d81f1219963aSupport vector machines and its applications in chemistry http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e871eb47ad28d35e8434e1843abab267Application of support vector machines to corporate credit rating prediction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7a6626a97ec54c576f934d8187f07959A hybrid SOFM-SVR with a filter-based feature selection for stock market forecasting http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=91242177cdcb853a3832a4e8df297a3fA Novel hybrid genetic algorithm for kernel function and parameter optimization in support vector regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b88c43cc38ed5ef24e87fb32c1e2746eSupport vector regression with chaos-based firefly algorithm for stock market price forecasting http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=87fb16de374a0e2e0ef8c58272705076References: Support vector machines for spam categorization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d35038b40f6d64c581932f54db35cec9Nonlinear prediction of chaotic time series using support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=83aef60916b197abb16ffb6f0fd5cbf6Stock market prediction system with modular neural networks http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fe1b1b53a92ee4768bb7d832912cc896Genetic algorithms approach to feature discretization in artificial neural networks for the prediction of stock price index http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=786061c6ac0a5ad9fa955290df831760Technical analysis of the financial markets : a comprehensive guide to trading methods and applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3c36d1c7474bdafb1a6a10aa1d39ec2fStock price pattern recognition-a recurrent neural network approach http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d732f7ff57b6253cc8ac784346db592dForecasting S&P 500 stock index futures with a hybrid AI system http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cb8475b03dc2f76ba2e80a3efaa9f99dPredicting stock price performance: a neural network approach http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4415f9ac8edfc22af79097cdd908eb0dImproving Returns on Stock Investment through Neural Network Selection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=452b239b67c74e7307d1db7c1f51da49Practical machine : learning tools and techniques with Java implementations = \u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398 : \u5b9e\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bdd74703b78445699e012445d4c169cdNonlinear Prediction of Chaotic Time Series using a Support Vector Machine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=11c222840c972873f30a4d64cd95e3bf
