name: Advances In Channel Compensation For SVM Speaker Recognitionurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/224612385_Advances_In_Channel_Compensation_For_SVM_Speaker_Recognitionpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Solomonoff, Alex,Campbell, W.M,Boardman, Ian,abstract: ABSTRACT  Cross-channel degradation is one of the significant challenges: facing speaker recognition systems. We study the problem for speaker recognition using support vector machines (SVMs). We perform channel compensation in SVM modeling by removing non-speaker nuisance dimensions in the SVM expansion space via projections. Training to remove these dimensions is accomplished via an eigenvalue problem. The eigenvalue problem attempts to reduce multisession variation for the same speaker, reduce different channel effects, and increase &quot;distance&quot; between different speakers. We apply our methods to a subset of the Switchboard 2 corpus. Experiments show dramatic improvement in performance for the cross-channel case.citations_number: 306Citation: Support vector machines using GMM supervectors for speaker verification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8d8ec04ebacbf78b890c0d9a95852ea7An overview of text-independent speaker recognition: From features to supervectors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=42062a3b66eaea144ad291d329a25784SVM Based Speaker Verification using a GMM Supervector Kernel and NAP Variability Compensation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b104838d9512b53ff547ed2a2eeb4775A Study of Interspeaker Variability in Speaker Verification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b17205ff8f4c66ab604120c7e1434502A study of inter-speaker variability in speaker verification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=385ab9d816cca19a3d502e16c49c5c7fJoint Factor Analysis Versus Eigenchannels in Speaker Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b2a55b9f1ac1190077e4066cdbbb6385SVM Based Speaker Verification using a GMM Supervector Kernel and NAP Variability Compensation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=16b172a2f399bc496078a37cdac450a6Fusion of Heterogeneous Speaker Recognition Systems in the STBU Submission for the NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation 2006 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2860d5eba3c98f65160d1592fcad509fAnalysis of Feature Extraction and Channel Compensation in a GMM Speaker Recognition System http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b00bac4e31df982f70adfcd14a9c99fdCompensation of Nuisance Factors for Speaker and Language Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ea73e85549080bce4eae30f0c67f8509References: Exploiting Generative Models in Discriminative Classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=12c87bed87e18b83b651f51a354e4aa9Kernel Principal Component Analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=839f06adde55560b6fd950a8b2fd09feScore Normalization for Text-Independent Speaker Verification Systems. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b1fda75152d2cfa3d465e80ee17261d1Score Normalization for Text-Independent Speaker Verification Systems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a0ac2c88399035acee5df4417964bab8Maximum-likelihood approach to stochastic matching for robust speech recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5eae2572189c7a0c042ee5ec685a983aChannel robust speaker verification via feature mapping http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=705433d9a6a51affd1b184d15c2b7304Channel robust speaker verification via feature mapping http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9237eb195726d4f09dc574b2d4952148Generalized linear discriminant sequence kernels for speaker recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=72155ed9a837217e8eee9a54fe73c231A model-based transformational approach to robust speaker recognition. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=07cefb0e5779b8097bca42d4ae9f4c6dThe NIST speaker recognition evaluation program http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dc9dd48978524ec59390319441e8017cSVMSVM: support vector machine speaker verification methodology http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b597615aebff9131e10104ef070b7a90A SVM\/HMM system for speaker recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3bdab4ab10985630e355f1d369849a72A Fast Algorithm for Stochastic Matching with Application to Robust Speaker Verification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f1d7a146d92b10f157e97673d633d3c0Rational Kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2b6bf8093cb98be5e1101cc5d60cab97Kernel principal component analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=521e8adc5f8818be50bf7d50d7dfadc5A fast algorithm for stochastic matching with application to robust speaker verification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=48786f732c50235f36b3078c92473a50
