The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the current state of the art from both methodological and experimental perspectives. The first part of the paper consists of a survey. We cover the main components of a pedestrian detection system and the underlying models. The second (and larger) part of the paper contains a corresponding experimental study. We consider a diverse set of state-of-the-art systems: wavelet-based AdaBoost cascade, HOG/linSVM, NN/LRF, and combined shape-texture detection. Experiments are performed on an extensive data set captured onboard a vehicle driving through urban environment. The data set includes many thousands of training samples as well as a 27-minute test sequence involving more than 20,000 images with annotated pedestrian locations. We consider a generic evaluation setting and one specific to pedestrian detection onboard a vehicle. Results indicate a clear advantage of HOG/linSVM at higher image resolutions and lower processing speeds, and a superiority of the wavelet-based AdaBoost cascade approach at lower image resolutions and (near) real-time processing speeds. The data set (8.5 GB) is made public for benchmarking purposes.citations_number: 912Citation: A survey on vision-based human action recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3d812e44988ba5dce01bc2f51f01fa8aPedestrian Detection: An Evaluation of the State of the Art http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=484460277f448fe1390d74c58c5af83eMonocular Pedestrian Detection: Survey and Experiments http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9b2b4dfde8a387a18632a8847c6f4e09New features and insights for pedestrian detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=af311d4ac8e2425a8a03e32beb0ecd8fThe Cityscapes Dataset for Semantic Urban Scene Understanding http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6f7eaa2854baae4352c7b6201ef36b8dMulti-cue onboard pedestrian detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cec25f2fcee53501a4dee10d5017c48cA Review of Computer Vision Techniques for the Analysis of Urban Traffic http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a3c21a848cf01e151667f39b20868c1bPeople detection in RGB-D data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4ee4c1358350ac1567b3a87bf9db5da3Multiresolution models for object detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b1e0c08df2e1687c48e887ec23656cd3Ten Years of Pedestrian Detection, What Have We Learned? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=13ba34e3f7a9506c70b86910eb4c307dReferences: A Versatile Camera Calibration Technique for High-Accuracy 3D Machine Vision Metrology Using Off-the-Shelf TV Cameras and Lenses http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a1c5fbd6d1a66383183644fe4d07752cStatistical pattern recognition: a review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=079121efa11798514b67b66d00de4289Filtering for Texture Classification: A Comparative Study http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=104cb6efd6ad12b243a53e55561a321cFast human detection using a cascade of histograms of oriented gradients http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=985b87994b2360764cfcaee706daca24Articulated body motion capture by annealed particle filtering http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b095073053360424b8572ca2ff22cd18Human Detection Using Oriented Histograms of Flow and Appearance http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f595f7608336789fdc4156467885e433Statistical models of appearance for medical image analysis and computer vision http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=279c269f28997c24900cc6c19b4547dfMCMC-Based Particle Filtering for Tracking a Variable Number of Interacting Targets http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=00639b3be30439ba8d4a45642d8f178aUsing vanishing points for camera calibration http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=90e5cb21fe44952c22a610a3e9e4495e
