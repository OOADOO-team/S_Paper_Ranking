name: The spectrum kernel: a string kernel for SVM protein classification.url: http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812799623_0053public_in: World Scientific Publishingauthors: Leslie C,Eskin E,Noble WS,abstract: We introduce a new sequence-similarity kernel, the spectrum kernel, for use with support vector machines (SVMs) in a discriminative approach to the protein classification problem. Our kernel is conceptually simple and efficient to compute and, in experiments on the SCOP database, performs well in comparison with state-of-the-art methods for homology detection. Moreover, our method produces an SVM classifier that allows linear time classification of test sequences. Our experiments provide evidence that string-based kernels, in conjunction with SVMs, could offer a viable and computationally efficient alternative to other methods of protein classification and homology detection.citations_number: 1200Citation: A Geometric Framework for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection: Detecting Intrusions in Unlabeled Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e6b96cb82b0552cbe10aa162cf4165b5Kernel Methods in Machine Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4ba954f8b0d51f1363e9fcf5709312e5Mismatch string kernels for discriminative protein classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=222a7428b4d8fece073fc047816b51ddCombining pairwise sequence similarity and support vector machines for detecting remote protein evolutionary and structural relationships. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2015a4ed1f0cf5dd676fc916bf428ea8A survey of kernels for structured data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fd82b70ba08d7d39fabfa5d253eeeb1bCombining pairwise sequence similarity and support vector machines for remote protein homology detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=19e7d9debeb2e2fd8b494bd2a1bfb030Discriminative Frequent Pattern Analysis for Effective Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2f2f4423079637c2b76b4f56302203bcFast Kernels for String and Tree Matching http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8f0e7b664b40f9de6039f651ca796053Discriminative Frequent Pattern Analysis for Effective Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a069747a69a6493b31b4c180b7601dc8Fast Kernels for String and Tree Matching http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3594199ff31c975d34e7fced12245f02References: Statistical Learning Theory and Induction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=162e23423300e341cf421decb85b9304On-Line Construction of Suffix Trees (eng) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a5c331f4c0b30b43919f846dc89df130PROSITE: a dictionary of sites and patterns in proteins http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b263bada7a14fa9b457a978cacfd5742Text classification using string kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3ee4341d15fead1aae34072af1b0ce17Profile analysis: detection of distantly related proteins http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b8894320d99a44c5c55f6c4e15c050dbMulti-class protein fold recognition using support vector machines and neural networks. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=70d7083c3bf89178c796c2409d574f6dOn Comparing Classifiers: Pitfalls to Avoid and a Recommended Approach http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=681ceeb69d21609bad04f27d9c41a880Hidden Markov models of biological primary sequence information. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=de25349552289c429d3c55a841707215Use of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate sequence matching http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d4c2f03df5f80ed81d1745c61601c7a1
