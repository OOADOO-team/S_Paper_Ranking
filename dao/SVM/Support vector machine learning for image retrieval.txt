name: Support vector machine learning for image retrievalurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/224074229_Support_vector_machine_learning_for_image_retrievalpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Zhang, Lei,Zhang, Lei,Lin, Fuzong,abstract: A novel method of relevance feedback is presented based on support vector machine learning in the content-based image retrieval system. A SVM classifier can be learned from training data of relevance images and irrelevance images marked by users. Using the classifier, the system can retrieve more images relevant to the query in the database efficiently. Experiments were carried out on a large-size database of 9918 images. It shows that the interactive learning and retrieval process can find correct images increasingly. It also shows the generalization ability of SVM under the condition of limited training samplescitations_number: 416Citation: A survey of content-based image retrieval with high-level semantics http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=265cb47cb25a8a4c081a059c89a34229Asymmetric bagging and random subspace for support vector machines-based relevance feedback in image retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3cf20690b1a5343c8c6c5d51269d9d63Manifold-ranking based image retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=68095440818ab73ce84b741a23455ad4An efficient and effective region-based image retrieval framework. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=727e54ec97ba74f9e40f4caf407785f9A SURVEY ON PATTERN RECOGNITION APPLICATIONS OF SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0de3cc6e23ebf6e7e34a2cd4d89b3d72Generalized Manifold-Ranking-Based Image Retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c7559c36de05d7b68b739ae579bb757fA unified log-based relevance feedback scheme for image retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cd745e57fba3dad1c44e9e95e082aa57Applications of Support Vector Machines for Pattern Recognition: A Survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4055019980b65024e8a8a8add793f4dbApplications of Support Vector Machines for Pattern Recognition: A Survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3d92d798187f72c266e4298e90ad4424Direct kernel biased discriminant analysis: a new content-based image retrieval relevance feedback algorithm http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=feafa9238672fe268a100e18dc5c111aReferences: Relevance feedback: a power tool for interactive content-based image retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8ba2aafdf624f9c0ee46e93825f7cc24Image Indexing Using Color Correlograms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=011edf914e0070dd0c2f7c7a5fe3d7daMindReader: Querying databases through multiple examples http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=99f13c0a550832c0bd8ff5f2202fcc01A unified framework for semantics and feature based relevance feedback in image retrieval systems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e295a24272a0c24eb90c49aaa8517064A novel relevance feedback technique in image retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=df8ad387d12eedcab1a3c77f8befa170
