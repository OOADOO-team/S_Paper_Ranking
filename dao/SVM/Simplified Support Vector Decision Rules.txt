Burges,abstract: A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a universal learning machine whose decision surface is parameterized by a set of support vectors, and by a set of corresponding weights. An SVM is also characterized by a kernel function. Choice of the kernel determines whether the resulting SVM is a polynomial classifier, a two-layer neural network, a radial basis function machine, or some other learning machine. SVMs are currently considerably slower in test phase than other approaches with similar generalization performance. To address this, we present a general method to significantly decrease the complexity of the decision rule obtained using an SVM. The proposed method computes an approximation to the decision rule in terms of a reduced set of vectors. These reduced set vectors are not support vectors and can in some cases be computed analytically. We give experimental results for three pattern recognition problems. The results show that the method can decrease the computational complexity of th...citations_number: 744Citation: A Tutorial on Support Vector Machines for Pattern Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=478e7ec22867ba234e18c5e17d8cd98bNonlinear Component Analysis as a Kernel Eigenvalue Problem http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0b7883d9668a414719d524ff633afb15Nonlinear component analysis as a kernel eigenvalue problem http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b20f7b9513d2dd48e69b151fd01703d7An overview of statistical learning theory http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f766c0cfb7bb144841f0a88a094d94d2Sparse bayesian learning and the relevance vector machine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4c52e3d4a44c728814da7eaa0fb5edd2An introduction to kernel-based learning algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a93bdd507c6e45b33431b1a1cc836d30Training Support Vector Machines: an Application to Face Detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a695bfc73b605e2cc76745541a626a3cAn introduction to kernel-based learning algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3628ed8c921b841657be18b1b1552fc8References: Extracting support data for a given task http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8c6d264ed3c1a6c55fe034331f12c99cComparison of classifier methods: a case study in handwritten digit recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=eea84c1fad0539cc7c25fe36b608f395Comparison of view-based object recognition algorithms using realistic 3D models http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4fe318e799a609f44a3f958eff64dc5cComparison of view-based object recognition algorithms using realistic 3D models http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f0e22f30595316ed9fa3e7f79e1a3ebe
