name: SVM Based Speaker Verification using a GMM Supervector Kernel and NAP Variability Compensationurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/224640862_SVM_Based_Speaker_Verification_using_a_GMM_Supervector_Kernel_and_NAP_Variability_Compensation?ev=auth_pubpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Campbell, W.M,Sturim, D.E,Reynolds, D.A,abstract: Gaussian mixture models with universal backgrounds (UBMs) have become the standard method for speaker recognition. Typically, a speaker model is constructed by MAP adaptation of the means of the UBM. A GMM supervector is constructed by stacking the means of the adapted mixture components. A recent discovery is that latent factor analysis of this GMM supervector is an effective method for variability compensation. We consider this GMM supervector in the context of support vector machines. We construct a support vector machine kernel using the GMM supervector. We show similarities based on this kernel between the method of SVM nuisance attribute projection (NAP) and the recent results in latent factor analysis. Experiments on a NIST SRE 2005 corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of the new techniquecitations_number: 717Citation: Front-End Factor Analysis for Speaker Verification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d2cbb84ad72219a834e90a3b164056d7An overview of text-independent speaker recognition: From features to supervectors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=42062a3b66eaea144ad291d329a25784Fusion of Heterogeneous Speaker Recognition Systems in the STBU Submission for the NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation 2006 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2860d5eba3c98f65160d1592fcad509fRegression from patch-kernel http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b844542597a0d31ed546dacc73115699Regression from patch-kernel http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e09aac22840d41ed5ddbec644089ac93Real-world acoustic event detection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ff0e55d2a9f99a13d5452135ccea68dcGMM Supervector Based SVM with Spectral Features for Speech Emotion Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d6d36ef3589d8274164d42674bd6ec24State-of-the-Art Performance in Text-Independent Speaker Verification Through Open-Source Software http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=59d4c7e35fac3c14fc86c0596579d8faDiscriminatively trained Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis for speaker verification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=61ed66f8fcbca3e6aa16a38c3f50cb8bDiscriminatively trained Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis for speaker verification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d66f30a1631e905135d77ac343c247c5References: Support vector machines using GMM supervectors for speaker verification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8d8ec04ebacbf78b890c0d9a95852ea7Generalized linear discriminant sequence kernels for speaker recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=72155ed9a837217e8eee9a54fe73c231Advances In Channel Compensation For SVM Speaker Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=03c3bb78e297fa077219ef94aec57b89Fast approximation of Kullback-Leibler distance for dependence trees and hidden Markov models http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d00c254f5b480f2587a731a24c20903eComments on \"Fast approximation of Kullback-Leibler distance for dependence trees and hidden Markov models\" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1aabb449220aab09145eb99f1d108a37Speaker adaptive cohort selection for tnorm in text-independent speaker verification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=88b1b734f8d4bdf27e93be6dcd8e5786SVMSVM: support vector machine speaker verification methodology http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b597615aebff9131e10104ef070b7a90
