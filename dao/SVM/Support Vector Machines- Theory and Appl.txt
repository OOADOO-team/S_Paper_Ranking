name: Support Vector Machines: Theory and Applicationsurl: http://rd.springer.com/book/10.1007/b95439public_in: Springerauthors: Wang,abstract: Summary: This chapter presents a summary of the issues discussed during the one day workshop on &quot;Support Vector Machines (SVM) Theory and Applications&quot; organized as part of the Advanced Course on Artificial Intelligence (ACAI â€™99) in Chania, Greece [19]. The goal of the chapter is twofold: to present an overview of the background theory and current understanding of SVM, and to discuss the papers presented as well as the issues that arose during the workshop. Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been recently developed in the framework of statistical learning theory, and have been successfully applied to a number of applications, ranging from time series prediction, to face recognition, to biological data processing for medical diagnosis. Their theoretical foundations and their experimental success encourage further research on their characteristics, as well as their further use.citations_number: 669Citation: Clinical relevance of oxidative stress in male factor infertility: an update http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cea5a2d01f6500ff46a5200acf3c0241A Selective, Cell-Permeable Optical Probe for Hydrogen Peroxide in Living Cells http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=daa29de3a904517cbe504aba479fd85fBoronate Oxidation as a Bioorthogonal Reaction Approach for Studying the Chemistry of Hydrogen Peroxide in Living Systems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=36c732b273880246eadfe6a70505865fNox2 redox signaling maintains essential cell populations in the brain http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cc78339e04c4a8061fbfc34d4d1d135aA multi-objective artificial immune algorithm for parameter optimization in support vector machine. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5d2aed1aeb971e7323dd08a35edea3d2Prediction of cytochrome P450 3A4, 2D6, and 2C9 inhibitors and substrates by using support vector machines. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=145327ed77d402b3bd21a8005644d24dBioinformatics with soft computing http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3fdaacd902c139697db34d1e654a9b01In situ detection and localization of lipid peroxidation in individual bovine sperm cells. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b208f5c1fd49719b8895601ba4dc4f69Prediction of RNA-binding proteins from primary sequence by a support vector machine approach http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5b9103b60f2f7986c7ed1496a2582cc5Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase: a link between insulin secretion, glucose metabolism and oxidative stress. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=53404d2e6ee90bd1dd56cb1d9ac19d69References: Prediction of protein secondary structure at better than 70% accuracy. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b3aa07548899b1bde9e13cfd0eeb9e26Missing value estimation methods for DNA microarrays http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=12a9b4c32dad36709d9f87690968e1c7Combining evolutionary information and neural networks to predict protein secondary structure http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8fb8c567835b9a5caab2543815c250c3On the algorithmic implementation of multiclass kernel-based vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b47acd19b1fd48eebecffeb19e54274fSupport vector machines for histogram-based image classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=166aeb4cc5fd24ee3e129acde3158edfPredicting the secondary structure of globular proteins using neural network models. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b307a4d5dd0974b3e65df8e2f35eb200Support vector machines: Training and applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a9510c9b33d7c27d96fcdfed403be7caPREDICTION OF PROTEIN CONFORMATION http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2b96d15714105674e2b8727c8f33e95fImprovements in protein secondary structure prediction by an enhanced neural network. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7130c4fb556cc22b150eff2d24f2c88aA novel method of protein secondary structure prediction with high segment overlap measure: support vector machine approach. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a2ba11491ae669adc3c553402f134f8fFinancial time series prediction using least squares support vector machines within the evidence framework. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ece847161a8280c50cfdb8077251339eLocal learning algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=636a8b5895b174248288ebd2f8e42616Protein secondary structure prediction with a neural network http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c3da2e251a6d0115c7d02762829a68a9Generalization performance of support vector machines and other pattern classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=483c1dbe910babed6effd86c2b8828dbPrediction of protein secondary structure by combining nearest-neighbor algorithms and multiple sequence alignments. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=44acac69d00a72e9eaa300fa67660432Protein secondary structure prediction using logic-based machine learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d97b261d39d2b9e5bda45b3573b53316STRUCTURE OF HAEMOGLOBIN.
