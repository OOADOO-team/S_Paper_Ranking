In this paper, we study the RSVM from the viewpoint of sampling design, its robustness, and the spectral analysis of the reduced kernel. We consider the nonlinear separating surface as a mixture of kernels. Instead of a full model, the RSVM uses a reduced mixture with kernels sampled from certain candidate set. Our main results center on two major themes. One is the robustness of the random subset mixture model. The other is the spectral analysis of the reduced kernel. The robustness is judged by a few criteria as follows: 1) model variation measure; 2) model bias (deviation) between the reduced model and the full model; and 3) test power in distinguishing the reduced model from the full one. For the spectral analysis, we compare the eigenstructures of the full kernel matrix and the approximation kernel matrix. The approximation kernels are generated by uniform random subsets. The small discrepancies between them indicate that the approximation kernels can retain most of the relevant information for learning tasks in the full kernel. We focus on some statistical theory of the reduced set method mainly in the context of the RSVM. The use of a uniform random subset is not limited to the RSVM. This approach can act as a supplemental algorithm on top of a basic optimization algorithm, wherein the actual optimization takes place on the subset-approximated data. The statistical properties discussed in this paper are still valid.citations_number: 260Citation: Extreme learning machine for regression and multiclass classification. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6edb04901d6ffc75c8c36aae6e3bb14dExtreme learning machines: a survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4bf48d06b7c37584d833c5720587a7e3Reduced Support Vector Machines: A Statistical Theory http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=335f7ae142ed47e55654c842f6a206cdModel selection for support vector machines via uniform design http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5f3307d3a6b7c5b392083781ba671bfdPSVM: Parallelizing Support Vector Machines on Distributed Computers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3025ac45d040cedb6fed2ce61e8817c8Land cover mapping of large areas using chain classification of neighboring Landsat satellite images http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=468744437ebcd793a19b2f29c8624645\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=26f9ca1b19c9d0692d7d4ed45a39fd6eMaxi\u2013Min Margin Machine: Learning Large Margin Classifiers Locally and Globally http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d8e4ce459ef975f13a9ec9f49afda46fAdditive Support Vector Machines for Pattern Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=93990ef22baecfbe8f2404496222359fBreast cancer and liver disorders classification using artificial immune recognition system (AIRS) with performance evaluation by fuzzy resource allocation... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a4cfc4cd9f492099bf2fda82712b91a1References: A Tutorial on Support Vector Machines for Pattern Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=478e7ec22867ba234e18c5e17d8cd98bBenchmarking Least Squares Support Vector Machine Classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f3624e73e75bd085cbfb1a2473fc8604On Estimation of a Probability Density Function and Mode http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=69dd317fd9a3edcec3bda77886448306Least squares support vector machines classifiers : a multi two-spiral benchmark problem http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ba0066cd82d6f5880b5499b4cb8c1761Fisher discriminant analysis with kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=251c0945c575f836a659d8e9431a596eRemarks on Some Nonparametric Estimates of a Density Function http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=765e536ff1e8946f16a16cf362a1b55dUsing the Nystr\u00f6m method to speed up kernel machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1204114af7a52e2da6c8a6301453ae48Multicategory proximal support vector machine classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1d15c90b43eac9e303d102de41ba3642
