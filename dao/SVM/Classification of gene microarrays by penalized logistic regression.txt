The support vector machine (SVM) has been successfully applied to microarray cancer diagnosis problems. However, one weakness of the SVM is that given a tumor sample, it only predicts a cancer class label but does not provide any estimate of the underlying probability. We propose penalized logistic regression (PLR) as an alternative to the SVM for the microarray cancer diagnosis problem. We show that when using the same set of genes, PLR and the SVM perform similarly in cancer classification, but PLR has the advantage of additionally providing an estimate of the underlying probability. Often a primary goal in microarray cancer diagnosis is to identify the genes responsible for the classification, rather than class prediction. We consider two gene selection methods in this paper, univariate ranking (UR) and recursive feature elimination (RFE). Empirical results indicate that PLR combined with RFE tends to select fewer genes than other methods and also performs well in both cross-validation and test samples. A fast algorithm for solving PLR is also described.citations_number: 342Citation: Regularization and variable selection via the elastic net http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0224b36c4af8aadd1b02636e969f6f16Regularization Paths for Generalized Linear Models via Coordinate Descent. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=387ec2fe1fef98187cff8346472448b1A Model-Based Background Adjustment for Oligonucleotide Expression Arrays http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=05f6fd9ab1ddbca1faf8162fd6bcea53The elements of statistical learning: data mining, inference and prediction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=750667e009573a8c55df2c8b4a47fe95A shrinkage approach to large-scale covariance matrix estimation and implications for functional genomics http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=adbecc8266980ff2ef69a107ec6c111dThe Entire Regularization Path for the Support Vector Machine. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=adda330a623c8b9f3f89b1702b917853L1 Regularization Path Algorithm for Generalized Linear Models http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=85af715df7a921cb38809a868858c722Kernel Logistic Regression and the Import Vector Machine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=48825d0a051ebb084ef5a26caaa6ac35Regularized linear discriminant analysis and its application in microarrays. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=916b9843f92f1c0e0a63b32158ecf55aPenalized logistic regression for detecting gene interactions. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1c5a50c209d0647d98cc63b68ffae5deReferences: Some results on Tchebycheffian spline functions \u2606 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cd4e41d253d917b9b36f8d96d208f1d8Angiogenic role for glycodelin in tumorigenesis. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d32236ffb8972cf33e2291498f2ee898Kernel logistic regression and the import vector machine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d1416db5000f19d2332f8769803f70f7Clustering Objects on Subsets of Attributes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=28a889c90f3da7e10cb53832a9e22eccBoosting as a Regularized Path to a Maximum Margin Classifier http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e54886bb9c0762debc6e75aeee7baeedClassification of multiple cancer types by multicategory support vector machines using gene expression data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d58531d1b92b0c03d6f141e7331ac82A Fast Dual Algorithm for Kernel Logistic Regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8b6ab74b546817e6ebae15bf81eddc88
