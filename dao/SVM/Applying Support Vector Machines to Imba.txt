name: Applying Support Vector Machines to Imbalanced Data Setsurl: http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-540-30115-8_7public_in: Springerauthors: Rehan Akbani,Stephen Kwek,Nathalie Japkowicz,abstract: Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been extensively studied and have shown remarkable success in many applications. However the success of SVM is very limited when it is applied to the problem of learning from imbalanced datasets in which negative instances heavily outnumber the positive instances (e.g. in gene profiling and detecting credit card fraud). This paper discusses the factors behind this failure and explains why the common strategy of undersampling the training data may not be the best choice for SVM. We then propose an algorithm for overcoming these problems which is based on a variant of the SMOTE algorithm by Chawla et al, combined with Veropoulos et alâ€™s different error costs algorithm. We compare the performance of our algorithm against these two algorithms, along with undersampling and regular SVM and show that our algorithm outperforms all of them.citations_number: 908Citation: Learning from Imbalanced Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=53206051b7c6b12d6ec7ad914bea41edCost-sensitive boosting for classification of imbalanced data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2deead97c86c1489e777e5827f730d41SVMs Modeling for Highly Imbalanced Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9c13830688c5a780ca672e60269327b8Support vector machines classification with a very large-scale taxonomy http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1cfaf5c0f6ee8851a0d53c4c6abc4946CLASSIFICATION OF IMBALANCED DATA: A REVIEW http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d2778c6f9db9873d2b70c7160af8cb1eAdaBoost with SVM-based component classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=15294d402e314c09548c8c9db29849d5Face recognition using total margin-based adaptive fuzzy support vector machines. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=288b26c5d2ec484a79bda74f5671f0d7Learning on the border: active learning in imbalanced data classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=60c72b9dbbdf2f51fc2b4d764cc8995eLearning on the border:active learning in imbalanced data classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c8097882611f8f915d4377c307725feemicroPred: effective classification of pre-miRNAs for human miRNA gene prediction. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1f52fff599fecea4b7118750a6ec9258References: Text categorization with Support Vector Machines: Learning with many relevant features http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=58aa6cfa340e6ae6809c5deadd07d88eText categorization with Support Vector Machines: Learning with many relevant features http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2f3ab6001f10fb375bcdb6d859e23e5eSMOTE: synthetic minority over-sampling technique http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=28300870422e64fd0ac338860cd0010aSupport vector machine active learning for image retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0fce0f8f406f6cc460652a2caed9116cAn Introduction to Support Vector Machines and Other Kernel-based Learning Methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0c522e3cf4b0b69b8c1a26197f04a20cOn kernel-target alignment http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5937c42ebbf7c1055b90c34debe30101Tolerating noisy, irrelevant and novel attributes in instance-based learning algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6bbff39e7f245c8b946bd548275c6618Learning When Negative Examples Abound http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a4d6d6f7ed13d8f54ded3ec88fe0d8b4Learning when negative examples abound http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=88e607f91b14dcc9fdfc8cde4f3a2d9fLearning when negative examples abound http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0ff2b6eec090f40583e699319a98d02f
