name: Object-oriented software for quadratic programmingurl: http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/external-ref?access_num=10.1145/641876.641880&amp;link_type=DOIpublic_in: Oxford Univ Pressauthors: Gertz, E. Michael, Wright, Stephen J.,abstract: The object-oriented software package OOQP for solving convex  quadratic programming problems (QP) is described. The primal-dual  interior point algorithms supplied by OOQP are implemented in a way that  is largely independent of the problem structure. Users may exploit  problem structure by supplying linear algebra, problem data, and  variable classes that are customized to their particular applications.  The OOQP distribution contains default implementations that solve  several important QP problem types, including general sparse and dense  QPs, bound-constrained QPs, and QPs arising from support vector machines and Huber regression. The implementations supplied with the OOQP distribution are based on such well known linear algebra packages as MA27/57, LAPACK, and PETSc. OOQP demonstrates the usefulness of object-oriented design in optimization software development, and establishes standards that can be followed in the design of software packages for other classes of optimization problems. A number of the classes in OOQP may also be reusable directly in other codescitations_number: 262Citation: Surface phenotype and antigenic specificity of human interleukin 17-producing T helper
