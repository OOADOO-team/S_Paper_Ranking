name: Variable Selection Using SVM-based Criteriaurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221996663_Variable_Selection_Using_SVM_based_Criteriapublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Rakotomamonjy, Alain,abstract: We propose new methods to evaluate variable subset relevance with a view to variable selection. Relevance criteria are derived from Support Vector Machines and are based on weight vector wÂ² or generalization error bounds sensitivity with respect to a variable. Experiments on linear and non-linear toy problems and real-world datasets have been carded out to assess the effectiveness of these criteria. Results show that the criterion based on weight vector derivative achieves good results and performs consistently well over the datasets we used.citations_number: 654Citation: An introduction to
