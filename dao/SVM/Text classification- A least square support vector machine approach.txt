name: Text classification: A least square support vector machine approachurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156849460600038Xpublic_in: Elsevierauthors: Vikramjit Mitra,ChiaJiu Wang,Satarupa Banerjee,abstract: This paper presents a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) that performs text classification of noisy document titles according to different predetermined categories. The system&#039;s potential is demonstrated with a corpus of 91,229 words from University of Denver&#039;s Penrose Library catalogue. The classification accuracy of the proposed LS-SVM based system is found to be over 99.9%. The final classifier is an LS-SVM array with Gaussian radial basis function (GRBF) kernel, which uses the coefficients generated by the latent semantic indexing algorithm for classification of the text titles. These coefficients are also used to generate the confidence factors for the inference engine that present the final decision of the entire classifier. The system is also compared with a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Na√Øve Bayes (NB) classifier and the comparison clearly claims that the proposed LS-SVM based architecture outperforms the KNN and NB based system. The comparison between the conventional linear SVM based classifiers and neural network based classifying agents shows that the LS-SVM with LSI based classifying agents improves text categorization performance significantly and holds a lot of potential for developing robust learning based agents for text classification.citations_number: 169Citation: Parameter determination of support vector machine and feature selection using simulated annealing approach http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d2e4b9a053fca7768e7099275abd2d99A novel LS-SVMs hyper-parameter selection based on particle swarm optimization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b8bacea3e7eff6e46565a0b22468c81cA two-stage feature selection method for text categorization by using information gain, principal component analysis and genetic algorithm http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=608956a059230d2619708e50fff46f1f\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=387a238ed43254bcab2b400f24d05e78Patent classification system using a new hybrid genetic algorithm support vector machine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ef894da6f844f3d60de80148ed2c78b2Hybrid robust support vector machines for regression with outliers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=df36d772367b7b846dc66bc755db3e6b\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u56de\u5f52\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u62c9\u66fc\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b7d6c655e62552bba6983a8c00f96608\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u56de\u5f52\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7a88949bbc6b0462da4eaad8109f178d\u79fb\u52a8\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6e1666f20f876bb9e059a4598b5cad46Combination of modified BPNN algorithms and an efficient feature selection method for text categorization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=aafbbc3815e1394c9f8da52b379ff5ffReferences: A re-examination of text categorization methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=98714cb5f2ebfd46708df1d5d927f368A comparison of classifiers and document representations for the routing problem http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1ac97db45c813a4094b21aa6b64f05c3Feature selection for text categorization on imbalanced data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e7a5b1121446205f72bcf0a6822ec7e9Feature selection for text categorization on imbalanced data. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8035c35e13e5e50c4923343eaf7a811bLatent Semantic Kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=963a7db0f89ba232be76c6c80757533dUsing latent semantic indexing for information filtering http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=09d1ef45dd1dc7fdd9f46305f07c0073A multispan language modeling framework for large vocabulary speech recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c31f56261f34295b6c6d9000cb0db4beUsing latent semantic indexing for information filtering http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9ec7e551f2a9470f771f342170fb5574Automatic relevance determination for least squares support vector machine regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6f9e49b0e340009d593226676af67de7Recurrent neural network learning for text routing http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=47ac20559ad89c6dd7b6324b6feb43ffRecurrent neural network learning for text routing http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7f6d8d5707163ee0b2c1ef3efcd8a9b8Effects of crystal orientation on microstructure of molten pool in laser rapidly solidified DD2 single crystal http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a5f10a218c61d1f7767f7ff6cdab2884Bayesian inference for LS-SVMs on large data sets using the Nystrom method http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a6624d202051a6cdedfb8fd6af986ed7
