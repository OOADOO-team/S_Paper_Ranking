name: Statistical Performance of Support Vector Machinesurl: http://www.jstor.org/stable/25464636public_in: JSTORauthors: Blanchard, G,Bousquet, O,Massart, P,abstract: The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm is well known to the computer learning community for its very good practical results. The goal of the present paper is to study this algorithm from a statistical perspective, using tools of concentration theory and empirical processes. Our main result builds on the observation made by other authors that the SVM can be viewed as a statistical regularization procedure. From this point of view, it can also be interpreted as a model selection principle using a penalized criterion. It is then possible to adapt general methods related to model selection in this framework to study two important points: (1) what is the minimum penalty and how does it compare to the penalty actually used in the SVM algorithm; (2) is it possible to obtain &quot;oracle inequalities&quot; in that setting, for the specific loss function used in the SVM algorithm? We show that the answer to the latter question is positive and provides relevant insight to the former. Our result shows that it is possible to obtain fast rates of convergence for SVMs.citations_number: 134Citation: On the convergence rate of l p -norm multiple kernel learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4efa58a0b375a0159fbf5ec1b0627b8e2004 IMS Medallion Lecture: Local Rademacher complexities and oracle inequalities in risk minimization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cc5b5708a41df7125d70ed6ceb2c6d29Classification with a Reject Option using a Hinge Loss http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=84d8843acda5586c3f52bbf62affec4dEstimating Individualized Treatment Rules Using Outcome Weighted Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=44002ee43a8c67e6ffdfbf1880a1b543SPARSITY IN MULTIPLE KERNEL LEARNING http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e29d4f37997f904f34e167d6faa2c947Response of single benthic metrics and multi-metric methods to anthropogenic pressure gradients, in five distinct European coastal and transitional ecosystems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0e429502e09f220584f121dac474cc6dSharp analysis of low-rank kernel matrix approximations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=819e1cc662455e2d23b60c720bd57122Optimal weighted nearest neighbour classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4029730867d1a9f42f12cbd09e7f2b9eLearning from dependent observations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0fb6f25231aa8346ab07a17c6bf7aa3fREGULARIZATION IN KERNEL LEARNING http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4d8a6f69d025ae5e2e9c41f835af9a17References: Learning with kernels : http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c46f9be11358ddc22442d3bda73941f9Regularization Networks and Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d4831e7dd7e6a454ecaf2fa79425b94eRademacher and Gaussian Complexities: Risk Bounds and Structural Results http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c352a110f35625b38ca00b4959a39464Rademacher and Gaussian Complexities: Risk Bounds and Structural Results http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d6d820d67f782db632bf391699ac887aRademacher and Gaussian Complexities: Risk Bounds and Structural Results http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=875b5f153a75b931415c3f26b308c1f7Convexity, Classification, and Risk Bounds http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f4ba280ba324e58e379a1fbc0f0907e6Concentration Inequalities and Model Selection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=45c14b75efc38071146755f6818b1662Scale-sensitive dimensions, uniform convergence, and learnability http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6fc4f60b02507c52542d5a3e9eebdc65On the influence of the kernel on the consistency of support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=911439329473db45320c343b960fdd85Optimal aggregation of classifiers in statistical learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6dede1231200cc931a83d44d5bfc32b0Smooth Discrimination Analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f0b457eb8678e9a661b19e7c7a813da3Local Rademacher Complexities http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2714b60885623ef8b28d0c22bb42eb1eEmpirical margin distributions and bounding the generalization error of combined classifiers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=12bb36bd359dc9e6d5908c839aae2720Discussion: \"Local Rademacher complexities and oracle inequalities in risk minimization'' [Ann.
