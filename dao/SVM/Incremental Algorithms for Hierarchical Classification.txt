name: Incremental Algorithms for Hierarchical Classificationurl: http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2274361public_in: AMSauthors: Cesa-Bianchi, Nicol√≤,Gentile, Claudio,Zaniboni, Luca,abstract: We study the problem of classifying data in a given taxonomy when classifications associated with multiple and/or partial paths are allowed. We introduce a new algorithm that incrementally learns a linear-threshold classifier for each node of the taxonomy. A hierarchical classification is obtained by evaluating the trained node classifiers in a top-down fashion. To evaluate classifiers in our multipath framework, we define a new hierarchical loss function, the H-loss, capturing the intuition that whenever a classification mistake is made on a node of the taxonomy, then no loss should be charged for any additional mistake occurring in the subtree of that node. Making no assumptions on the mechanism generating the data instances, and assuming a linear noise model for the labels, we bound the H-loss of our on-line algorithm in terms of the H-loss of a reference classifier knowing the true parameters of the label-generating process. We show that, in expectation, the excess cumulative H-loss grows at most logarithmically in the length of the data sequence. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the precise dependence of the rate of convergence on the eigenstructure of the data each node observes. Our theoretical results are complemented by a number of experiments on texual corpora. In these experiments we show that, after only one epoch of training, our algorithm performs much better than Perceptron-based hierarchical classifiers, and reasonably close to a hierarchical support vector machine.citations_number: 264Citation: Mining Multi-label Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=07bcdec7d8cc3ee475a5349c4a8f2031Decision trees for hierarchical multi-label classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0cef959fe193f87ca0f22c103cb6c78eA survey of hierarchical classification across different application domains http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1a7d02c5cfdc3564c779e829f10e459bMulti-label prediction via compressed sensing http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e493fd75b678239893e8e85d5cd4cc57Multi-Label Prediction via Compressed Sensing http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=800e2a737354a3ff981e2e3920544449Kernel-Based Learning of Hierarchical Multilabel Classification Models http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=446312a25218eaae10e1f8574cefd44eKnows what it knows: a framework for self-aware learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4d3865e4cba1bc10e6e524d1f01c53d7Knows what it knows: a framework for self-aware learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=621d2d44ca68b10bc1cfa5b77e19503dRefined experts:improving classification in large taxonomies http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e3c4f9637e5dc33f6b6eefdc6fc8fa3cMulti-label classification on tree- and DAG-structured hierarchies http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7cf023b6fd8a4cf2eb5478dc8a0ff2dcReferences: Hierarchically Classifying Documents Using Very Few Words http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cf5c8b922b67dc65c2c63d8c300c0395Improving Text Classification by Shrinkage in a Hierarchy of Classes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=71e3cd7c6e15bcfad537eda82573672eLeast Squares Estimates in Stochastic Regression Models with Applications to Identification and Control of Dynamic Systems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9d22068a4480494dedc35cbea88baf8aHierarchical Text Categorization Using Neural Networks http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e6b12883046596b49c368133fc44c8b4Hierarchical Text Classification and Evaluation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=51429ff98b677ad3bf6fc3192e0b7a4aRelative Loss Bounds for On-line Density Estimation with the Exponential Family of Distributions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1a5f6a5db9057d5321f0785378ea7b9aLarge margin hierarchical classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=07b95f357bc1da14e68bdc1e31d42a39Strong Consistency of Least Squares Estimates in Multiple Regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2931abcd1c9d5144d3173694764442c0ON CONVERGENCE PROOFS FOR PERCEPTRONS http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b768eba309605bef79a29ad7facd1901A Second-Order Perceptron Algorithm http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=88992b286d386f262a8617c970dcba33Strong consistency of least squares estimates in multiple regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c0e74f7e8187e914906fc63aef3ca242A Second-Order Perceptron Algorithm http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5bde0ebdd088599e078609fb3124aea0Turning Yahoo to Automatic WebPage Classifier http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6f2b057712c86b912bc32fe3c3fac44aLearning Probabilistic Linear-Threshold Classifiers via Selective Sampling. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=79de893d4ee395a262c777aaca9007acAn Online Algorithm for Hierarchical Phoneme Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8464ff4ce0bb18237d6a4784eb5854a0Regret Bounds for Hierarchical Classification with Linear-Threshold Functions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ea7bf47c06d61720f002b0ad6cdd0de3Learning Probabilistic Linear-Threshold Classifiers via Selective Sampling http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d81468548c6cf7a7e2892f3788a3937aHierarchical Text Classification and Evaluation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d83134ccd676877723ee4b0a06ab6302
