name: Making large-scale support vector machine learning practical.url: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/262333164_Making_large-scalepublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Joachims, T,abstract: ABSTRACT  Training a support vector machine (SVM) leads to a quadratic optimization problem with bound constraints and one linear equality constraint. Despite the fact that this type of problem is well understood, there are many issues to be considered in designing an SVM learner. In particular, for large learning tasks with many training examples, off-the-shelf optimization techniques for general quadratic programs quickly become intractable in their memory and time requirements. SVMlight is an implementation of an SVM learner which addresses the problem of large tasks. This chapter presents algorithmic and computational results developed for SVMlight V2.0, which make large-scale SVM training more practical. The results give guidelines for the application of SVMs to large domains.citations_number: 2409Citation: LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b1552ffd60e8a942090f6dfadd26687LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=309e25e4e7d5ca5cbe656208c220a1afVlfeat: an open and portable library of computer vision algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=aa3acaf941768b77a92ea5aaa1cf293bOn the algorithmic implementation of multiclass kernel-based vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b47acd19b1fd48eebecffeb19e54274fDuplicate Record Detection: A Survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=44a27a0f02df42319e90f690016af65fWorking Set Selection Using Second Order Information for Training Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f5b8426229b0f88f7d2cd0b1273d29efPegasos: Primal Estimated sub-GrAdient SOlver for SVM http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d19c179365153d7743cf5aab07472191Multiple kernel learning, conic duality, and the SMO algorithm http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4a6f07782f2ad1ab4be13d6e9a444232Human Detection Using Oriented Histograms of Flow and Appearance http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f595f7608336789fdc4156467885e433References: Support vector machines: Training and applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a9510c9b33d7c27d96fcdfed403be7caOptimization:theory and applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bdae0e13bb24f0711325cc55e1fbd800Multitask Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=de41cd0414414ba209ac9cbf89bbb57dSupport vector machines: training and applications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cc4a4a4faf642ee18309ee3011de35d5
