name: Statistical Analysis of Some Multi-Category Large Margin Classification Methods.url: http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2248016public_in: AMSauthors: Zhang, Tong,abstract: Summary: The purpose of this paper is to investigate statistical properties of risk minimization based multi-category classification methods. These methods can be considered as natural extensions of binary large margin classification. We establish conditions that guarantee the consistency of classifiers obtained in the risk minimization framework with respect to the classification error. Examples are provided for four specific forms of the general formulation, which extend a number of known methods. Using these examples, we show that some risk minimization formulations can also be used to obtain conditional probability estimates for the underlying problem. Such conditional probability information can be useful for statistical inferencing tasks beyond classification.citations_number: 207Citation: Listwise approach to learning to rank:theory and algorithm http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=37b73cf4add6622c7d6b3220b0ec4b1bMulti-class AdaBoost http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9cb826e45e48753f7b5457444fc47e40On the Consistency of Multiclass Classification Methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8528c6d5fa80aa57290c0799a9150459On the consistency of multiclass classification methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f16560b7644d2935a4791989da043a08On the Consistency of Multiclass Classification Methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c6d84fd98f1584670c0153bfa8686957Subset Ranking Using Regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=81e87e3af77b47febeb5d6e505f51a2dSelf-reported Morisky score for identifying nonadherence with cardiovascular medications. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ff8412e5835a2be01d2db55c04d6cfbcRobust Truncated Hinge Loss Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c42ab65513041300f42abeee2da6cf75Learning from ambiguously labeled images http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=244fb4b366b078c1d9b0431a8c365890Learning from ambiguously labeled images http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=073b0e3b54ad5c543d41588ccaaa0565References: Improved Boosting Algorithms Using Confidence-rated Predictions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5e13bbc68b478aa95b0afcf09300a45bOn the algorithmic implementation of multiclass kernel-based vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b47acd19b1fd48eebecffeb19e54274fSmooth Discrimination Analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f0b457eb8678e9a661b19e7c7a813da3The Existence and Asymptotic Properties of a Backfitting Projection Algorithm under Weak Conditions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bfb923faddf818901487aca9ac276c27Text Chunking based on a Generalization of Winnow. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cc6b737b1d7a6b761f91dad84b57e777Sparseness of Support Vector Machines. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ac07acf7e5e6ba2e18eb32916817575bSupport Vector Machines and the Bayes Rule in Classification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5505c5ce82ef12d518b3a0429322c1f8Covering Number Bounds of Certain Regularized Linear Function Classes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=188d69961d14eb0e50a66b9781cbde49Support Vector Machines are Universally Consistent http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bd6a84a0271bc187a762eb709e63b59c
