name: Applying support vector machines to predict building energy consumption in tropical regionurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778804002981public_in: Elsevierauthors: Dong, Bing,Cao, Cheng,Lee, Siew Eang,abstract: The methodology to predict building energy consumption is increasingly important for building energy baseline model development and measurement and verification protocol (MVP). This paper presents support vector machines (SVM), a new neural network algorithm, to forecast building energy consumption in the tropical region. The objective of this paper is to examine the feasibility and applicability of SVM in building load forecasting area. Four commercial buildings in Singapore are selected randomly as case studies. Weather data including monthly mean outdoor dry-bulb temperature ( T 0), relative humidity (RH) and global solar radiation (GSR) are taken as three input features. Mean monthly landlord utility bills are collected for developing and testing models. In addition, the performance of SVM with respect to two parameters, C and É›, was explored using stepwise searching method based on radial-basis function (RBF) kernel. Finally, all prediction results are found to have coefficients of variance (CV) less than 3% and percentage error (%error) within 4%.citations_number: 321Citation: Time Series Prediction Using Support Vector Machines: A Survey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a79927ed51624eac3b0064835efa47c6Using support vector machines for long-term discharge prediction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=84ef8b254681eff873b55f6c1d6b6019A review on the prediction of building energy consumption http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=eafccec556b4f53ca8d47db976692e77- Wetland Systems to Control Urban Runoff http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d5bcaee1667295f901f4e787ebdad761Paradigm shift in urban energy systems through distributed generation: Methods and models http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0cc98d103b26116dcf444b421a979420\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u5728\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u5f84\u6d41\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3bac59938089cc9286ed0469e0fdc502Bus Arrival Time Prediction Using Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0ce5870357089d34d8874e1f300f872dPredicting hourly cooling load in the building: A comparison of support vector machine and different artificial neural networks http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fad63d0fdc8dc32f7776e8dd37b50089State of the art in building modelling and energy performances prediction: A review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fae9742ccbeb8931c6aa666005e49d05Predicting future hourly residential electrical consumption: A machine learning case study http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f8b61c40b62308968149d188d7dd386bReferences: Practical selection of SVM parameters and noise estimation for SVM regression. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0d853b048c13ec5d3e86214a7b0b41ddExtracting support data for a given task http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8c6d264ed3c1a6c55fe034331f12c99cPredicting time series with support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e9bad9f7b1e95f02b76e6ac8369f9f04Nonlinear prediction of chaotic time series using support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=83aef60916b197abb16ffb6f0fd5cbf6Support vector machine with adaptive parameters in financial time series forecasting http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f6fbaab8642cdfeaf7a3ea616c93cb4fSupport vector machines for dynamic reconstruction of a chaotic system http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5212ff136e2b4a1e477c3208ee992732Applied Regression Analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d92b2a9bd832a81e67743123c800901cA Fourier series model to predict hourly heating and cooling energy use in commercial buildings with outdoor temperature as the only weather variable http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f4c20d213d32a175e1da7df7629993f0Savings from Demand-Side Management Programs in US Electric Utilities http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9c75a8e0fe889f6134883bd79f2885aa
