Jorissen, Michael K. Gilson,abstract: Abstract The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is an algorithm that derives a model used for the classification of data into two categories and which has good generalization properties. This study applies the SVM algorithm to the problem of virtual screening for molecules with a desired activity. In contrast to typical applications of the SVM, we emphasize not classification but enrichment of actives by using a modified version of the standard SVM function to rank molecules. The method employs a simple and novel criterion for picking molecular descriptors and uses cross-validation to select SVM parameters. The resulting method is more effective at enriching for active compounds with novel chemistries than binary fingerprint-based methods such as binary kernel discrimination.citations_number: 278Citation: Benchmarking sets for molecular docking. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3487ce7fec0fe8fda98452be0e801660Comparison of Shape-Matching and Docking as Virtual Screening Tools http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4bb26514fb00a88ded65d2425cc753d1Molecular similarity analysis in virtual screening: foundations, limitations and novel approaches. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a9df8c9fcb21d4c0e39739bc24ecc16eApplications of Support Vector Machines in Chemistry http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=70dc46018ff6efb0b63b548ee38b5b8aNew methods for ligand-based virtual screening: use of data fusion and machine learning to enhance the effectiveness of similarity searching http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2242274973b376b0472eb59980b2afceCurrent trends in ligand-based virtual screening: molecular representations, data mining methods, new application areas, and performance evaluation. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9ce4baae87697bf17b26e2af32c7bd9fVirtual Screening in Drug Discovery - A Computational Perspective http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=630a8138f16886228d1b26433ff62bd9Recent advances in computer-aided drug design http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=625bdbf51d8ac39488befa18e89b7336Assessing different classification methods for virtual screening http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e2cd5c5dcab7570250e0d8cc537b660cSimilarity methods in chemoinformatics http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ec4f45f0ef84dcf4cb369f6f55ce5dd7References: Gene Selection for Cancer Classification using Support Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8854f0c7f668ca96b4ea79e580d025b0Glide: a new approach for rapid, accurate docking and scoring. 1.
