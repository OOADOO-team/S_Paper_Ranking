name: Sparse Bayesian Learning and the Relevance Vector Machineurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2413122_Sparse_Bayesian_Learning_and_the_Relevance_Vector_Machinepublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Tipping, Michael E,abstract: This paper introduces a general Bayesian framework for obtaining sparse solutions to regression and classification tasks utilising models linear in the parameters. Although this framework is fully general, we illustrate our approach with a particular specialisation that we denote the &#039;relevance vector machine&#039; (RVM), a model of identical functional form to the popular and state-of-the-art &#039;support vector machine&#039; (SVM). We demonstrate that by exploiting a probabilistic Bayesian learning framework, we can derive accurate prediction models which typically utilise dramatically fewer basis functions than a comparable SVM while offering a number of additional advantages. These include the benefits of probabilistic predictions, automatic estimation of &#039;nuisance&#039; parameters, and the facility to utilise arbitrary basis functions (e.g. non-&#039;Mercer&#039; kernels).citations_number: 4411Citation: A fast diffeomorphic image registration algorithm http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=94dfa3ff37b1ce21eb22a1fad1e5c0ddBayesian Compressive Sensing http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c297b71c6c0b1710a32a5bc4a2aef964The free-energy principle: A unified brain theory? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bc5f4e75e460faabf689336b88c2559fA.: Sparse multinomial logistic regression: Fast algorithms and generalization bounds http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f2c97c721c147948d6661bd2e5e7dc47Sparse Representation for Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6763fdb8dc37721c35d42e53fb5b3b5aUse of the zero-norm with linear models and kernel methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a05f14c12659172c73daaa45e52eb3b9Sparse Bayesian learning for basis selection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8dce2c6b25e9358d9d3058c4f151ffe1The kernel recursive least-squares algorithm http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=37db2830aeb273fc3318d5f66b4ffac8Sparsity preserving projections with applications to face recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4aa8dc5be9ff0d0ffead147661c3418aLarge-Scale Bayesian Logistic Regression for Text Categorization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=72afce5e77c1e35951d1b53b5385ea6bReferences: Bayesian Learning for Neural Networks http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1b3e887dc200105f8d5cd5c3a87860c6The Evidence Framework applied to Classification Networks http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=eaaf5a0db4d35ce4ab6ae28a1dbb7c29Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=79656463ddee2b97868c6f00fa3923a4Soft Margins for AdaBoost http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f03e203be204e3b7fb6db9460cbdc4aeInput Space Versus Feature Space in Kernel-Based Methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=edd0273817621c00de6cfe949e4f9cccInput space versus feature space in kernel-based methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ef19aa870ff39d351e779117d1762250The connection between regularization operators and support vector kernels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=05ab68cdab9948b35c1761eaf7244a91Simplified support vector decision rules http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=12ea54cba354e6c0f8824ec966b19cddPrediction with Gaussian Processes: From Linear Regression to Linear Prediction and Beyond http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7846fb5e00621436135c806cd2302848Bayesian classification with Gaussian processes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6216cff26744ecb3de9aee8257025f06Prediction with Gaussian Processes: From Linear Regression to Linear Prediction and Beyond http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ff04b9b7ae2ec062d6de45fe752ee6caIntroduction to Gaussian Processes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=36577f17eb9c30a300a20cb2f805865aVariational Relevance Vector Machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cc22875b4f49c5b740fb9443e16d25bfBayesian Regularization and Pruning Using a Laplace Prior http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6dc7e00929086fa403779b91026e4248The evidence framework applied to support vector machines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=430ea95972735dfc84b38901e36fecaeComparison of Approximate Methods for Handling Hyperparameters http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cf37042adc0e485dce719a144a19e92aBayesian Methods for Backpropagation Networks http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e11578bf8a67523e8c12d5b4ceeaa790Linear programs for automatic accuracy control in regression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=94bbbbfe819e4aa6684dfd645846145cLeast Absolute Shrinkage is Equivalent to Quadratic Penalization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5ac961f13c460cf1801578cb2a9178e3Least Absolute Shrinkage is Equivalent to Quadratic Penalization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=72ed663df04b7f9a41df03fc824974f1Bayesian Methods for Backpropagation Networks http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d4d92d4f3445d9c6f3c4e4824f525317
