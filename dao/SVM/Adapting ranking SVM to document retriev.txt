name: Adapting ranking SVM to document retrieval.url: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221299659_Adapting_ranking_SVM_to_document_retrievalpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Cao, Yunbo,Jun Xu,Liu, TieYan,abstract: The paper is concerned with applying learning to rank to document retrieval. Ranking SVM is a typical method of learning to rank. We point out that there are two factors one must consider when applying Ranking SVM, in general a &quot;learning to rank&quot; method, to document retrieval. First, correctly ranking documents on the top of the result list is crucial for an Information Retrieval system. One must conduct training in a way that such ranked results are accurate. Second, the number of relevant documents can vary from query to query. One must avoid training a model biased toward queries with a large number of relevant documents. Previously, when existing methods that include Ranking SVM were applied to document retrieval, none of the two factors was taken into consideration. We show it is possible to make modifications in conventional Ranking SVM, so it can be better used for document retrieval. Specifically, we modify the &quot;Hinge Loss&quot; function in Ranking SVM to deal with the problems described above. We employ two methods to conduct optimization on the loss function: gradient descent and quadratic programming. Experimental results show that our method, referred to as Ranking SVM for IR, can outperform the conventional Ranking SVM and other existing methods for document retrieval on two datasets.citations_number: 533Citation: Learning to Rank for Information Retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7bdcd1c22c180ddab2ebcb982715a2b1\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\u7efc\u8ff0 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e245774aee200af039015ca050af5b9bAdaRank:a boosting algorithm for information retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=080b4efe85a2b9ce69b17099351f7322A support vector method for optimizing average precision http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a4a61efd278fe75be43de592dc58315cA dynamic bayesian network click model for web search ranking http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0377b6d687edfa521259fb6b46d4d3e0Web page classification: Features and algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=386df247e229f64db773d2dda3fc9835Web page classification:Features and algorithms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e511707e9fc4fcb151bfc60512b320ffLearning to Rank for Information Retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ae58d5cd87158d6acad3c982e3dd7ddcLETOR: A benchmark collection for research on learning to rank for information retrieval http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6c7809c186b13b04430082d13ba1e884Yahoo!
