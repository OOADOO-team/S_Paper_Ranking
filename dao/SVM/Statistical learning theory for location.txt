name: Statistical learning theory for location fingerprinting in wireless LANsurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128604002610public_in: Elsevierauthors: Mauro Brunato, Roberto Battiti,abstract: In this paper, techniques and algorithms developed in the  framework of Statistical Learning Theory are applied to the problem of  determining the location of a wireless device by measuring the signal  strength values from a set of access points ( location fingerprinting ). Statistical Learning Theory provides a rich theoretical basis for  the development of models starting from a set of examples. Signal  strength measurement is part of the normal operating mode of wireless equipment, in particular Wi-Fi, so that no special-purpose hardware is required. The proposed techniques, based on the Support Vector Machine paradigm, have been implemented and compared, on the same data set, with  other approaches considered in scientific literature. Tests performed in  a real-world environment show that results are comparable, with the  advantage of a low algorithmic complexity in the normal operating phase.  Moreover, the algorithm is particularly suitable for classification,  where it outperforms the other techniques.
