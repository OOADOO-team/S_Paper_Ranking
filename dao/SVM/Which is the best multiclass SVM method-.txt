name: Which is the best multiclass SVM method? An empirical studyurl: http://link.springer.com/10.1007/11494683_28public_in: Springerauthors: Kaibo Duan, S. Sathiya Keerthi,abstract: Multiclass SVMs are usually implemented by combining several two-class SVMs. The one-versus-all method using winner-takes-all strategy and the one-versus-one method implemented by max-wins voting are popularly used for this purpose. In this paper we give empirical evidence to show that these methods are inferior to another one-versus-one method: one that uses Plattâ€™s posterior probabilities together with the pairwise coupling idea of Hastie and Tibshirani. The evidence is particularly strong when the training dataset is sparse.citations_number: 419Citation: Simplemkl http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b496d7b74c49e33b433befff447a37b0Which Is the Best Multiclass SVM Method?
