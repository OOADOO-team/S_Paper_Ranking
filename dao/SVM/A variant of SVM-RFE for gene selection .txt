name: A variant of SVM-RFE for gene selection in cancer classification with expression dataurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/4124417_A_variant_of_SVM-RFE_for_gene_selection_in_cancer_classification_with_expression_data?ev=sim_pubpublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Duan, K,Rajapakse, J.C,abstract: Feature selection is a commonly addressed problem in classification. In gene expression-based cancer classification, a large number of genes in conjunction with a small number of samples makes the gene selection problem more important but also more challenging. Support vector machine as a popular classification algorithm, has been successfully used in SVM-RFE method for gene selection. This paper proposes a variant of SVM-RFE to do gene selection for cancer classification with expression data. Multiple support vector machine classifiers from a leave-one-out procedure are used to compute the feature ranking scores. The numerical experiments also show the good and stable performance of the proposed method.citations_number: 248Citation: Feature selection based on mutual information criteria of max-dependency,
