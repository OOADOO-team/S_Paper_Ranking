name: Convolutional LSTM Network: A Machine Learning Approach for Precipitation Nowcastingurl: http://www.oalib.com/paper/4084152public_in: Noneauthors: Shi, Xingjian,Chen, Zhourong,Wang, Hao,abstract: Abstract:  The goal of precipitation nowcasting is to predict the future rainfall intensity in a local region over a relatively short period of time. Very few previous studies have examined this crucial and challenging weather forecasting problem from the machine learning perspective. In this paper, we formulate precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem in which both the input and the prediction target are spatiotemporal sequences. By extending the fully connected LSTM (FC-LSTM) to have convolutional structures in both the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions, we propose the convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) and use it to build an end-to-end trainable model for the precipitation nowcasting problem. Experiments show that our ConvLSTM network captures spatiotemporal correlations better and consistently outperforms FC-LSTM and the state-of-the-art operational ROVER algorithm for precipitation nowcasting.citations_number: 225Citation: Unsupervised Learning for Physical Interaction through Video Prediction "Chelsea Finn" "Ian Goodfellow" "Sergey Levine" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0e65c63b7ba7d35fe55229af7f658264Delving Deeper into Convolutional Networks for Learning Video Representations "Ballas, Nicolas" "Yao, Li" "Pal, Chris" "Courville, Aaron" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fcdafd8b7b83cf8b3780fa7b2a814487Spatio-temporal video autoencoder with differentiable memory "Patraucean, Viorica" "Handa, Ankur" "Cipolla, Roberto" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6939680f73ecc62579b78044349b6347Deep Predictive Coding Networks for Video Prediction and Unsupervised Learning "Lotter, William" "Kreiman, Gabriel" "Cox, David" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8e03e5ce4dcdd513e783a4d0eca19cf4Dynamic Filter Networks "De Brabandere, Bert" "Jia, Xu" "Tuytelaars, Tinne" "Van Gool, Luc" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a914b9abee42fc0efb6da3020c9a813cRecurrent Instance Segmentation "Bernardino Romera-Paredes" "Philip Hilaire Sean Torr" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d97c3cdedadae8f89ddfa0f31ed64d87Very deep convolutional networks for end-to-end speech recognition "Yu Zhang" "William Chan" "Navdeep Jaitly" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f7dbad2fbcbe748ad50d4fc8cfd51199Video Pixel Networks "Kalchbrenner, Nal" "Oord, Aaron van den" "Simonyan, Karen" "Danihelka, Ivo" "Vinyals, Oriol" "Graves, Alex" "Kavukcuoglu, Koray" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=32810fbf9beb25fdfc21dcdc2def142eVideoLSTM Convolves, Attends and Flows for Action Recognition "Li, Zhenyang" "Gavves, Efstratios" "Jain, Mihir" "Snoek, Cees G.
