As a matter of fact, object representation by means of graphs has a number of advantages over feature vectors. Therefore, various algorithms for graph based machine learning have been proposed in the literature. However, in contrast with the emerging interest in graph based representation, a lack of standardized graph data sets for benchmarking can be observed. Common practice is that researchers use their own data sets, and this behavior cumbers the objective evaluation of the proposed methods. In order to make the different approaches in graph based machine learning better comparable, the present paper aims at introducing a repository of graph data sets and corresponding benchmarks, covering a wide spectrum of different applications.citations_number: 340Citation: Recent advances in graph-based pattern recognition with applications in document analysis.
