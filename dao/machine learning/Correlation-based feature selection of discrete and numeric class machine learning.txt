name: Correlation-based feature selection of discrete and numeric class machine learningurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/33051238_Correlation-based_feature_selection_of_discrete_and_numeric_class_machine_learningpublic_in: Seventeenth International Conference on Machine Learningauthors: Hall, Mark A,abstract: Algorithms for feature selection fall into two broad categories: wrappers that use the learning algorithm itself to evaluate the usefulness of features and filters that evaluate features according to heuristics based on general characteristics of the data. For application to large databases, filters have proven to be more practical than wrappers because they are much faster. However, most existing filter algorithms only work with discrete classification problems. This paper describes a fast, correlation-based filter algorithm that can be applied to continuous and discrete problems. The algorithm often out-performs the well-known ReliefF attribute estimator when used as a preprocessing step for naive Bayes, instance-based learning, decision trees, locally weighted regression, and model trees. It performs more feature selection than ReliefF does-reducing the data dimensionality by fifty percent in most cases. Also, decision and model trees built from the preprocessed data are often significantly smaller.citations_number: 348Citation: Eficient Feature Selection Via Analysis of Relevance and Redundancy "Yu, Lei" "Liu, Huan" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=da7d14d646da255ccc6011b08fa5750dUnsupervised feature selection using feature similarity "P.
