name: Protein Secondary Structure Prediction using Logic-Based Machine Learningurl: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1480619public_in: International Workshop on Inductive Logic Programmingauthors: Stephen Muggleton,Ross D. King,M.J.E. Sternberg,abstract: Many attempts have been made to solve the problem of predicting secondary structure from the primary sequence but the best performance results are still disappointing. In this paper, the use of a machine algorithm which allows relational descriptions is shown to lead to improved performance. The Inductive Logic Programming computer program, Golem, was applied to secondary structure prediction rules for alpha/alpha domain type . The input to the program consisted of 12 non-homologous (1612 residues) of known structure, together with a background knowledge describing the chemical and physical properties of the residues. Golem learned a small set of rules that predict which residues are part of the alpha-helices--based on their positional relationships and chemical and physical properties. The rules were tested on four independent non-homologous (416 residues) giving an accuracy of 81% (+/- 2%). This is an improvement, on identical data, over the previously reported result of 73% by King and Sternberg (1990, J. Mol. Biol., 216, 441-457) using the machine program PROMIS, and of 72% using the standard Garnier-Osguthorpe-Robson method. The best previously reported result in the literature for the alpha/alpha domain type is 76%, achieved using a neural net approach. Machine also has the advantage over neural network and statistical methods in producing more understandable results.citations_number: 358Citation: Prediction of protein secondary structure at better than 70% accuracy.
