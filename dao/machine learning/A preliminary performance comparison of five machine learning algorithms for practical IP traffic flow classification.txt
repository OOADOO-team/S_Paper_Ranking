name: A preliminary performance comparison of five machine learning algorithms for practical IP traffic flow classificationurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/220195367_A_preliminary_performance_comparison_of_five_machine_learning_algorithms_for_practical_IP_traffic_flow_classification?ev=prf_citpublic_in: ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Reviewauthors: Williams, Nigel, Zander, Sebastian, Armitage, Grenville,abstract: The identification of network applications through observation of associated packet traffic flows is vital to the areas of network management and surveillance. Currently popular methods such as port number and payload-based identification exhibit a number of shortfalls. An alternative is to use machine learning (ML) techniques and identify network applications based on per-flow statistics, derived from payload-independent features such as packet length and inter-arrival time distributions. The performance impact of feature set reduction, using Consistency-based and Correlation-based feature selection, is demonstrated on Na?ve Bayes, C4.5, Bayesian Network and Na?ve Bayes Tree algorithms. We then show that it is useful to differentiate algorithms based on computational performance rather than classification accuracy alone, as although classification accuracy between the algorithms is similar, computational performance can differ significantly.citations_number: 597Citation: A survey of techniques for internet traffic classification using machine learning "T.
