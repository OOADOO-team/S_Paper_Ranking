name: Cached Sufficient Statistics for Efficient Machine Learning with Large Datasetsurl: http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1622708public_in: Noneauthors: A. Moore,M. S. Lee,abstract: This paper introduces new algorithms and data structures for quick counting for machine learning datasets. We focus on the counting task of constructing contingency tables, but our approach is also applicable to counting the number of records in a dataset that match conjunctive queries. Subject to certain assumptions, the costs of these operations can be shown to be independent of the number of records in the dataset and loglinear in the number of non-zero entries in the contingency table.citations_number: 314Citation: Model-Based Clustering, Discriminant Analysis, and Density Estimation "Chris Fraley" "Adrian E.
