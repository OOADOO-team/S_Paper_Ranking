name: TensorFlow: Large-Scale Machine Learning on Heterogeneous Distributed Systemsurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/301839500_TensorFlow_Large-Scale_Machine_Learning_on_Heterogeneous_Distributed_Systemspublic_in: Noneauthors: abstract: Abstract:  TensorFlow is an interface for expressing machine learning algorithms, and an implementation for executing such algorithms. A computation expressed using TensorFlow can be executed with little or no change on a wide variety of heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile devices such as phones and tablets up to large-scale distributed systems of hundreds of machines and thousands of computational devices such as GPU cards. The system is flexible and can be used to express a wide variety of algorithms, including training and inference algorithms for deep neural network models, and it has been used for conducting research and for deploying machine learning systems into production across more than a dozen areas of computer science and other fields, including speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, information retrieval, natural language processing, geographic information extraction, and computational drug discovery. This paper describes the TensorFlow interface and an implementation of that interface that we have built at Google. The TensorFlow API and a reference implementation were released as an open-source package under the Apache 2.0 license in November, 2015 and are available at www.tensorflow.org.citations_number: 1300Citation: TensorFlow: a system for large-scale machine learning "Abadi, Martín" "Barham, Paul" "Chen, Jianmin" "Chen, Zhifeng" "Davis, Andy" "Dean, Jeffrey" "Devin, Matthieu" "Ghemawat, Sanjay" "Irving, Geoffrey" "Isard, Michael" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c6756f6d236ea24af14830dd8948e90dDeepLab: Semantic Image Segmentation with Deep Convolutional Nets, Atrous Convolution, and Fully Connected CRFs "Chen LC" "Papandreou G" "Kokkinos I" "Murphy K" "Yuille AL" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f7abb976fc6609b2bccfefcaba6e6e5fConvolutional Neural Networks on Graphs with Fast Localized Spectral Filtering "Defferrard, Michaël" "Bresson, Xavier" "Vandergheynst, Pierre" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3eba8c62e36bef8407584586eb634a6bIn-Datacenter Performance Analysis of a Tensor Processing Unit "Jouppi, Norman P" "Young, Cliff" "Patil, Nishant" "Patterson, David" "Agrawal, Gaurav" "Bajwa, Raminder" "Bates, Sarah" "Bhatia, Suresh" "Boden, Nan" "Borchers, Al" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f655d8bae8a5fd2a9907436000f5a2c4Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks "Finn, Chelsea" "Abbeel, Pieter" "Levine, Sergey" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=360cda04fb03d57cdd9a21ab7c9a2461An overview of gradient descent optimization algorithms "Ruder, Sebastian" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1d7fbc7fca9de35f53fea7bec4cf9113Domain Separation Networks "Konstantinos Bousmalis" "George Trigeorgis" "Nathan Silberman" "Dilip Krishnan" "Dumitru Erhan" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4052d453b0dd61a334ac9f0b4562b72bTarget-driven visual navigation in indoor scenes using deep reinforcement learning "Yuke Zhu" "Roozbeh Mottaghi" "Eric Kolve" "Joseph J.
