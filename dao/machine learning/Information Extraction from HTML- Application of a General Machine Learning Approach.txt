name: Information Extraction from HTML: Application of a General Machine Learning Approachurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2453183_Information_Extraction_from_HTML_Application_of_a_General_Machine_Learning_Approachpublic_in: Fifteenth National/tenth Conference on Artificial Intelligence/innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligenceauthors: Dayne Freitag,abstract: Because the World Wide Web consists primarily of text, information extraction is central to any effort that would use the Web as a resource for knowledge discovery. We show how information extraction can be cast as a standard machine learning problem, and argue for the suitability of relational learning in solving it. The implementation of a general-purpose relational learner for information extraction, SRV , is described. In contrast with earlier learning systems for information extraction, SRV makes no assumptions about document structure and the kinds of information available for use in learning extraction patterns. Instead, structural and other information is supplied as input in the form of an extensible token-oriented feature set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by adapting SRV for use in learning extraction rules for a domain consisting of university course and research project pages sampled from the Web. Making SRV Web-ready only involves adding several simple HTML-specific features to its basic feature set.citations_number: 551Citation: Web mining research: a survey "Kosala, Raymond" "Blockeel, Hendrik" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bbe6390eb3b4392d25a271658eaeb98bWrapper induction: Efficiency and expressiveness "Nicholas Kushmerick" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=405f094b386f8329f93b902b304dc3b9Learning to Extract Symbolic Knowledge from the World Wide Web "Craven, Mark" "McCallum, Andrew" "PiPasquo, Dan" "Mitchell, Tom" "Freitag, Dayne" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fd553b8c508edcedd5821ee4851c8c48A Survey of Web Information Extraction Systems "ChiaHui Chang" "Mohammed Kayed" "Moheb Ramzy Girgis" "Khaled F.
