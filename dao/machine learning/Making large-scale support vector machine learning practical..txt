name: Making large-scale support vector machine learning practical.url: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/262333164_Making_large-scalepublic_in: Advances in Kernel Methodsauthors: Joachims, T,abstract: ABSTRACT  Training a support vector machine (SVM) leads to a quadratic optimization problem with bound constraints and one linear equality constraint. Despite the fact that this type of problem is well understood, there are many issues to be considered in designing an SVM learner. In particular, for large learning tasks with many training examples, off-the-shelf optimization techniques for general quadratic programs quickly become intractable in their memory and time requirements. SVMlight is an implementation of an SVM learner which addresses the problem of large tasks. This chapter presents algorithmic and computational results developed for SVMlight V2.0, which make large-scale SVM training more practical. The results give guidelines for the application of SVMs to large domains.citations_number: 2409Citation: LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines "Chang, ChihChung" "Lin, ChihJen" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b1552ffd60e8a942090f6dfadd26687On the algorithmic implementation of multiclass kernel-based vector machines "Crammer, Koby" "Singer, Yoram" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a08f2b97b6d527cb618c83e7c67aeddbDuplicate Record Detection: A Survey "Elmagarmid, Ahmed K" "Ipeirotis, Panagiotis G" "Verykios, Vassilios S" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=44a27a0f02df42319e90f690016af65fWorking Set Selection Using Second Order Information for Training Support Vector Machines "Rong-En Fan" "Pai-Hsuen Chen" "Chih-Jen Lin" "Joachims, Thorsten" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f5b8426229b0f88f7d2cd0b1273d29efPegasos: Primal Estimated sub-GrAdient SOlver for SVM "Shai Shalev-Shwartz" "Yoram Singer" "Nathan Srebro" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d19c179365153d7743cf5aab07472191Multiple kernel learning, conic duality, and the SMO algorithm "Francis R.
