name: A Machine Learning Approach to Twitter User Classificationurl: http://www.mendeley.com/research/machine-learning-approach-twitter-user-classification/public_in: Noneauthors: Marco Pennacchiotti,AnaMaria Popescu,abstract: This paper addresses the task of user classification in social media, with an application to Twitter. We automatically infer the values of user attributes such as political orientation or ethnicity  by leveraging observable information such as the user behavior, network structure and the linguistic content of the user&amp;rsquo;s Twitter feed. We employ a machine learning approach which relies on a comprehensive set of features derived from such user information. We report encouraging experimental results on 3 tasks with different characteristics: political affiliation detection, ethnicity identification and detecting affinity for a particular business. Finally, our analysis shows that rich linguistic features  prove consistently valuable across the 3 tasks and show great promise for additional user classification needs.citations_number: 258Citation: Birds of the Same Feather Tweet Together: Bayesian Ideal Point Estimation Using Twitter Data "Pablo Barberá" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e700da388b29eeb9907089bb2e37524aA Meta-Analysis of State-of-the-Art Electoral Prediction From Twitter Data "Daniel Gayo-Avello" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c311d2e3cba277d4d0b8ff752a3bbfc2Semantics + filtering + search = twitcident. exploring information in social web streams "Fabian Abel" "Claudia Hauff" "Geert-Jan Houben" "Richard Stronkman" "Ke Tao" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c04339dd0a5a956aea6b7d2d8473d5c4A Meta-Analysis of State-of-the-Art Electoral Prediction From Twitter Data "Gayo Avello, Daniel" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0c175d02110bc1b898d3e38194a6db7fThe power of prediction with social media "Schoen Harald" "GayoAvello Daniel" "Takis Metaxas Panagiotis" "Mustafaraj Eni" "Strohmaier Markus" "Gloor Peter" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=55ecce41be29d296909238351e7487abIdentifying communicator roles in twitter "Ramine Tinati" "Leslie Carr" "Wendy Hall" "Jonny Bentwood" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d1f6721128f6c35d0e5554c5d2d00b45Asking questions of targeted strangers on social networks "Jeffrey Nichols" "Jeon-Hyung Kang" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5048f83e03b66d1dff125b6bf29c8909Twitter Sentiment Analysis: A Bootstrap Ensemble Framework "Ammar Hassan" "Ahmed Abbasi" "Daniel Zeng" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=90d3a6c0e1cabfa6272ac5cf9f84a391Echo Chamber or Public Sphere?
