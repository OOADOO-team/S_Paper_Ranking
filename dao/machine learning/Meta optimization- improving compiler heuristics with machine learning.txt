Finding a heuristic that performs well on a broad range of applications is a tedious and difficult process. This paper introduces Meta Optimization, a methodology for automatically fine-tuning compiler heuristics. Meta Optimization uses machine-learning techniques to automatically search the space of compiler heuristics. Our techniques reduce compiler design complexity by relieving compiler writers of the tedium of heuristic tuning. Our machine-learning system uses an evolutionary algorithm to automatically find effective compiler heuristics. We present promising experimental results. In one mode of operation Meta Optimization creates application-specific heuristics which often result in impressive speedups. For hyperblock formation, one optimization we present in this paper, we obtain an average speedup of 23% (up to 73%) for the applications in our suite. Furthermore, by evolving a compiler&#039;s heuristic over several benchmarks, we can create effective, general-purpose heuristics. The best general-purpose heuristic our system found for hyperblock formation improved performance by an average of 25% on our training set, and 9% on a completely unrelated test set. We demonstrate the efficacy of our techniques on three different optimizations in this paper: hyperblock formation, register allocation, and data prefetching.citations_number: 303Citation: Search-Based Software Engineering: Trends, Techniques and Applications "Mark" "AFSHIN MANSOURI" "YUANYUAN ZHANG" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f3ae35304d3a3493346f784ad205df41Automatic Performance Tuning of Sparse Matrix Kernels "Vuduc, Richard Wilson" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=134a5c827a7d585a574ada49d6408bafIterative Optimization in the Polyhedral Model: Part I, One-Dimensional Time "Pouchet" "LouisNoel" "Bastoul" "Cedric" "Cohen" "Albert" "Vasilache" "Nicolas" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9066c2458a58460e571155687e0674daRapidly Selecting Good Compiler Optimizations using Performance Counters "John Cavazos" "Grigori Fursin" "Felix Agakov" "Edwin Bonilla" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=370f818b7b4d083ee6b3076eab3b9d6aPredicting unroll factors using supervised classification "M.
