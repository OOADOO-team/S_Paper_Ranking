name: DianNao: a small-footprint high-throughput accelerator for ubiquitous machine-learningurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/261845797_DianNao_a_small-footprint_high-throughput_accelerator_for_ubiquitous_machine-learningpublic_in: 《Acm Sigplan Notices》authors: Chen, Tianshi,Du, Zidong,Sun, Ninghui,abstract: Machine-Learning tasks are becoming pervasive in a broad range of domains, and in a broad range of systems (from embedded systems to data centers). At the same time, a small set of machine-learning algorithms (especially Convolutional and Deep Neural Networks, i.e., CNNs and DNNs) are proving to be state-of-the-art across many applications. As architectures evolve towards heterogeneous multi-cores composed of a mix of cores and accelerators, a machine-learning accelerator can achieve the rare combination of efficiency (due to the small number of target algorithms) and broad application scope. Until now, most machine-learning accelerator designs have focused on efficiently implementing the computational part of the algorithms. However, recent state-of-the-art CNNs and DNNs are characterized by their large size. In this study, we design an accelerator for large-scale CNNs and DNNs, with a special emphasis on the impact of memory on accelerator design, performance and energy. We show that it is possible to design an accelerator with a high throughput, capable of performing 452 GOP/s (key NN operations such as synaptic weight multiplications and neurons outputs additions) in a small footprint of 3.02 mm2 and 485 mW; compared to a 128-bit 2GHz SIMD processor, the accelerator is 117.87x faster, and it can reduce the total energy by 21.08x. The accelerator characteristics are obtained after layout at 65 nm. Such a high throughput in a small footprint can open up the usage of state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms in a broad set of systems and for a broad set of applications.citations_number: 270Citation: BinaryConnect: training deep neural networks with binary weights during propagations "Matthieu Courbariaux" "Yoshua Bengio" "Jean-Pierre David" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6b91bf2c149d9c64e8813c9b71a24c68Binarized Neural Networks: Training Deep Neural Networks with Weights and Activations Constrained to +1 or -1 "Courbariaux, Matthieu" "Hubara, Itay" "Soudry, Daniel" "El-Yaniv, Ran" "Bengio, Yoshua" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=66e684d89ae684bbbc4183a2ac7a3c46EIE: Efficient Inference Engine on Compressed Deep Neural Network "Han, Song" "Liu, Xingyu" "Mao, Huizi" "Pu, Jing" "Pedram, Ardavan" "Horowitz, Mark A."
