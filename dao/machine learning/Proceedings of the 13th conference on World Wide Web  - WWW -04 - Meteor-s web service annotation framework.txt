name:  [ACM Press the 13th conference - New York, NY, USA (2004.05.17-2004.05.20)] Proceedings of the 13th conference on World Wide Web  - WWW \"04 - Meteor-s web service annotation frameworkurl: http://www.springerlink.com/content/6k94qdb5ap7jat0jpublic_in: Noneauthors: Patil, Abhijit A., Oundhakar, Swapna A., Sheth, Amit P.,abstract: The World Wide Web is emerging not only as an infrastructure for data, but also for a broader variety of resources that are increasingly being made available as Web services. Relevant current standards like UDDI, WSDL, and SOAP are in their fledgling years and form the basis of making Web services a workable and broadly adopted technology. However, realizing the fuller scope of the promise of Web services and associated service oriented architecture will requite further technological advances in the areas of service interoperation, service discovery, service composition, and process orchestration. Semantics, especially as supported by the use of ontologies, and related Semantic Web technologies, are likely to provide better qualitative and scalable solutions to these requirements. Just as semantic annotation of data in the Semantic Web is the first critical step to better search, integration and analytics over heterogeneous data, semantic annotation of Web services is an equally critical first step to achieving the above promise. Our approach is to work with existing Web services technologies and combine them with ideas from the Semantic Web to create a better framework for Web service discovery and composition. In this paper we present MWSAF (METEOR-S Web Service Annotation Framework), a framework for semi-automatically marking up Web service descriptions with ontologies. We have developed algorithms to match and annotate WSDL files with relevant ontologies. We use domain ontologies to categorize Web services into domains. An empirical study of our approach is presented to help evaluate its performance.citations_number: 858Citation: Service oriented architectures: approaches, technologies and research issues "Mike P.
