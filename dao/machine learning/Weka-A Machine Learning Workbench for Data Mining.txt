name: Weka-A Machine Learning Workbench for Data Miningurl: http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-09823-4_66public_in: Noneauthors: Eibe Frank,Mark Hall,Geoffrey Holmes,abstract: The Weka workbench is an organized collection of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing tools. The basic way of interacting with these methods is by invoking them from the command line. However, convenient interactive graphical user interfaces are provided for data exploration, for setting up large-scale experiments on distributed computing platforms, and for designing configurations for streamed data processing. These interfaces constitute an advanced environment for experimental data mining.
