name: Flow Clustering Using Machine Learning Techniquesurl: http://www.springerlink.com/content/exh697awv2ctv8jrpublic_in: International Workshop on Passive and Active Network Measurementauthors: Anthony McGregor,Mark Hall,Perry Lorier,abstract: Packet header traces are widely used in network analysis. Header traces are the aggregate of traffic from many concurrent applications. We present a methodology, based on machine learning, that can break the trace down into clusters of traffic where each cluster has different traffic characteristics. Typical clusters include bulk transfer, single and multiple transactions and interactive traffic, amongst others. The paper includes a description of the methodology, a visualisation of the attribute statistics that aids in recognising cluster types and a discussion of the stability and effectiveness of the methodology.citations_number: 647Citation: BLINC:multilevel traffic classification in the dark "Thomas Karagiannis" "Konstantina Papagiannaki" "Michalis Faloutsos" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=187376087e93d5b5749a5e3fe68af984Internet traffic classification using bayesian analysis techniques "Andrew W.
