Existing high-level parallel abstractions like MapReduce are insufficiently expressive while low-level tools like MPI and Pthreads leave ML experts repeatedly solving the same design challenges. By targeting common patterns in ML, we developed GraphLab, which improves upon abstractions like MapReduce by compactly expressing asynchronous iterative algorithms with sparse computational dependencies while ensuring data consistency and achieving a high degree of parallel performance. We demonstrate the expressiveness of the GraphLab framework by designing and implementing parallel versions of belief propagation, Gibbs sampling, Co-EM, Lasso and Compressed Sensing. We show that using GraphLab we can achieve excellent parallel performance on large scale real-world problems.citations_number: 550Citation: Distributed Optimization and Statistical Learning via the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers "Stephen Boyd" "Neal Parikh" "Eric Chu" "Borja Peleato" "Jonathan Eckstein" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f1f38796a7d5ec1f2998a5e2a2c2ef1dDistributed GraphLab: a framework for machine learning and data mining in the cloud "Yucheng Low" "Danny Bickson" "Joseph Gonzalez" "Carlos Guestrin" "Aapo Kyrola" "Joseph M.
