name: The use of the area under the ROC curve in the evaluation of machine learning algorithmsurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320396001422public_in: Noneauthors: Andrew P. Bradley,abstract: In this paper we investigate the use of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) as a performance measure for machine learning algorithms. As a case study we evaluate six machine learning algorithms (C4.5, Multiscale Classifier, Perceptron, Multi-layer Perceptron, K-Nearest Neighbours, and a Quadratic Discriminant Function) on six &quot;real world&quot; medical diagnostics data sets. We compare and discuss the use of AUC to the more conventional overall accuracy and find that AUC exhibits a number of desirable properties when compared to overall accuracy: increased sensitivity in Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests; a standard error that decreased as both AUC and the number of test samples increased; decision threshold independent; and it is invariant to a priori class probabilities. The paper concludes with the recommendation that AUC be used in preference to overall accuracy for ``single number&#039;&#039; evaluation of machine learning algorithms.citations_number: 3032Citation: SMOTE: synthetic minority over-sampling technique "Nitesh V.
