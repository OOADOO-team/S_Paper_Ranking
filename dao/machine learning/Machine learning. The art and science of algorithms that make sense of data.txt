name: Machine learning. The art and science of algorithms that make sense of dataurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/267125464_Machine_learning._The_art_and_science_of_algorithms_that_make_sense_of_datapublic_in: Noneauthors: Peter Flach,abstract: ABSTRACT  In the first chapter of his book, the author describes some basic ideas of machine learning such as supervised versus unsupervised learning, predictive versus descriptive paradigms, and machine learning models: logical, geometric and probabilistic. The next two chapters are still devoted to basic ideas: the second chapter explores instance space, features, classification, error rate, ROC curve, etc., all assuming binary classification. In Chapter 3 multi-class classifiers are introduced. The next three chapters use a logical model of machine learning. Chapter 4 discusses concept learning, Chapter 5 sketches how to generate decision trees, and Chapter 6 how to induce rule sets. The following two chapters use a geometric model of machine learning. In Chapter 7 linear models are discussed, using linear regression and support vector machines. In Chapter 8 nearest neighbor classification and the k-means algorithm of cluster analysis are described. In Chapter 9 probabilistic models such as naive Bayes, Gaussian mixture and a model based on compression are discussed. Chapter 11 provides information about taxonomy of features (categorical, ordinal and quantitative). Ensemble models of machine learning, such as bagging and boosting, are presented in the next chapter. Finally, the last chapter provides some instruction how to conduct machine learning experiments. This book is written in a simple way and it would be a good textbook for undergraduate students; however, lack of exercises may prevent it from adoption for some machine learning courses.citations_number: 167Citation: A unified view of performance metrics: translating threshold choice into expected classification loss "Peter Flach" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bdeb15217a4ee33f40841d131d6b6a0cA type theoretical framework for natural language semantics: the Montagovian generative lexicon "Retoré, Christian" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=67f5ca80b30a5de09aacbe81191229d9Finding Influential Users in Social Media Using Association Rule Learning "Fredrik Erlandsson" "Piotr Bródka" "Anton Borg" "Henric Johnson" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=53740a19b2757f15bd241b95002e4806Aggregative quantification for regression "Antonio Bella" "Cèsar Ferri" "José Hernández-Orallo" "María José Ramírez-Quintana" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5abbbc018728e866304ff458a257e0f4Classification of ABO3 perovskite solids: a machine learning study "G.
