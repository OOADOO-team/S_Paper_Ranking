name: Emotions from text: machine learning for text-based emotion predictionurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/220817578_Emotions_from_Text_Machine_Learning_for_Text-based_Emotion_Predictionpublic_in: Conference on Hlt/emnlpauthors: Alm, Cecilia Ovesdotter,Roth, Dan,Sproat, Richard,abstract: Abstract In addition to information, text contains attitudinal, and more specifically, emotional content. This paper explores the text-based emotion prediction problem empirically, using supervised machine learning with the SNoW learning architecture. The goal is to classify the emotional affinity of sentences in the narrative domain of children&#039;s fairy tales, for subsequent usage in appropriate expressive rendering of text-to-speech synthesis. Initial experiments on a preliminary data set of 22 fairy tales show encouraging results over a naïve baseline and BOW approach for classification of emotional versus non-emotional contents, with some dependency on parameter tuning. We also discuss results for a tripartite model which covers emotional valence, as well as feature set alternations. In addition, we present plans for a more cognitively sound sequential model, taking into consideration a larger set of basic emotions.citations_number: 553Citation: Affect Detection: An Interdisciplinary Review of Models, Methods, and Their Applications "Rafael A.
