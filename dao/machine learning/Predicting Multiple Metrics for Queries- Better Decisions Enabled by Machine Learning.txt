name: Predicting Multiple Metrics for Queries: Better Decisions Enabled by Machine Learningurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/220966297_Predicting_Multiple_Metrics_for_Queries_Better_Decisions_Enabled_by_Machine_Learningpublic_in: IEEE International Conference on Data Engineeringauthors: Archana Ganapathi,Harumi Kuno,Umeshwar Dayal,abstract: One of the most challenging aspects of managing a very large data warehouse is identifying how queries will behave before they start executing. Yet knowing their performance characteristics --- their runtimes and resource usage --- can solve two important problems. First, every database vendor struggles with managing unexpectedly long-running queries. When these long-running queries can be identified before they start, they can be rejected or scheduled when they will not cause extreme resource contention for the other queries in the system. Second, deciding whether a system can complete a given workload in a given time period (or a bigger system is necessary) depends on knowing the resource requirements of the queries in that workload. We have developed a system that uses machine learning to accurately predict the performance metrics of database queries whose execution times range from milliseconds to hours. For training and testing our system, we used both real customer queries and queries generated from an extended set of TPC-DS templates. The extensions mimic queries that caused customer problems. We used these queries to compare how accurately different techniques predict metrics such as elapsed time, records used, disk I/Os, and message bytes. The most promising technique was not only the most accurate, but also predicted these metrics simultaneously and using only information available prior to query execution. We validated the accuracy of this machine learning technique on a number of HP Neoview configurations. We were able to predict individual query elapsed time within 20% of its actual time for 85% of the test queries. Most importantly, we were able to correctly identify both the short and long-running (up to two hour) queries to inform workload management and capacity planning.citations_number: 207Citation: Detecting Large-Scale System Problems by Mining Console Logs "Wei Xu, Ling Huang Arm" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3c269b43cd997f524d78e0e424789cedCloudScale:elastic resource scaling for multi-tenant cloud systems "Zhiming Shen" "Sethuraman Subbiah" "Xiaohui Gu" "John Wilkes" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=520025a85812a6ea468c3e28049d410bPRESS: PRedictive Elastic ReSource Scaling for cloud systems "Zhenhuan Gong" "Xiaohui Gu" "Wilkes, J" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9f6f7d5eed6e7d1b532547bf217d18bcStatistics-driven workload modeling for the Cloud "Archana Ganapathi" "Yanpei Chen" "Armando Fox" "Randy Katz" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4ee95cd6acc04959e56438eb528a0f36ParaTimer:a progress indicator for MapReduce DAGs "Kristi Morton" "Magdalena Balazinska" "Dan Grossman" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c10b7a34e9d18a500072c8ebbb4cf672Intelligent management of virtualized resources for database systems in cloud environment "Pengcheng Xiong" "Yun Chi" "Shenghuo Zhu" "Hyun Jin Moon" "Calton Pu" "Hakan Hacigumus" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=482c09eaf3c7eab6bf91942920aa55acIntelligent management of virtualized resources for database systems in cloud environment "Pengcheng Xiong" "Yun Chi" "Shenghuo Zhu" "Hyun Jin Moon" "Calton Pu" "Hakan Hacigumus" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9b2bd9f3f9e537800cf26908047bcc63SCADS: Scale-Independent Storage for Social Computing Applications "Armbrust, Michael" "Fox, Armando" "Patterson, David" "Lanham, Nick" "Trushkowsky, Beth" "Trutna, Jesse" "Oh, Haruki" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c52147c8cec2885de4425a689c1465e3Advances and Challenges in Log Analysis "Adam Oliner" "Archana Ganapathi" "Wei Xu" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6d238e93db752f5e3f724a89ddb2416fPredicting performance via automated feature-interaction detection "Norbert Siegmund" "Sergiy S.
