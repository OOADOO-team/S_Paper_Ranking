Srihari,abstract: Merchants selling products on the Web often ask their customers to share their opinions and hands-on experiences on products they have purchased. Unfortunately, reading through all customer reviews is difficult, especially for popular items, the number of reviews can be up to hundreds or even thousands. This makes it difficult for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision. The OpinionMiner system designed in this work aims to mine customer reviews of a product and extract high detailed product entities on which reviewers express their opinions. Opinion expressions are identified and opinion orientations for each recognized product entity are classified as positive or negative. Different from previous approaches that employed rule-based or statistical techniques, we propose a novel machine learning approach built under the framework of lexicalized HMMs. The approach naturally integrates multiple important linguistic features into automatic learning. In this paper, we describe the architecture and main components of the system. The evaluation of the proposed method is presented based on processing the online product reviews from Amazon and other publicly available datasets.citations_number: 229Citation: A Survey of Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis "Bing Liu" "Lei Zhang" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=364c7dc1648e630f9f20e4395926612dJointly Modeling Aspects and Opinions with a MaxEnt-LDA Hybrid "Wayne Xin Zhao" "Jing Jiang" "Hongfei Yan" "Xiaoming Li" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=85a75f4618a829e3cad7ebf283a34df8Jointly modeling aspects and opinions with a MaxEnt-LDA hybrid "Zhao" "Wayne Xin" "Jiang" "Jing" "Yan" "Hongfei" "Li" "Xiaoming" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1f9a56444cc810d160faf6897129410aClustering product features for opinion mining "Zhongwu Zhai" "Bing Liu" "Hua Xu" "Peifa Jia" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=40a603eb1eba0eba590691660ae69decGrouping Product Features Using Semi-Supervised Learning with Soft-Constraints.
