name: DaDianNao: A Machine-Learning Supercomputerurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/283024298_DaDianNao_A_Machine-Learning_Supercomputerpublic_in: 2014 47th Annual IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO)authors: Yunji Chen,Ninghui Sun,Olivier Temam,abstract: Many companies are deploying services, either for consumers or industry, which are largely based on machine-learning algorithms for sophisticated processing of large amounts of data. The state-of-the-art and most popular such machine-learning algorithms are Convolutional and Deep Neural Networks (CNNs and DNNs), which are known to be both computationally and memory intensive. A number of neural network accelerators have been recently proposed which can offer high computational capacity/area ratio, but which remain hampered by memory accesses. However, unlike the memory wall faced by processors on general-purpose workloads, the CNNs and DNNs memory footprint, while large, is not beyond the capability of the on chip storage of a multi-chip system. This property, combined with the CNN/DNN algorithmic characteristics, can lead to high internal bandwidth and low external communications, which can in turn enable high-degree parallelism at a reasonable area cost. In this article, we introduce a custom multi-chip machine-learning architecture along those lines. We show that, on a subset of the largest known neural network layers, it is possible to achieve a speedup of 450.65x over a GPU, and reduce the energy by 150.31x on average for a 64-chip system. We implement the node down to the place and route at 28nm, containing a combination of custom storage and computational units, with industry-grade interconnects.citations_number: 198Citation: BinaryConnect: training deep neural networks with binary weights during propagations "Matthieu Courbariaux" "Yoshua Bengio" "Jean-Pierre David" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6b91bf2c149d9c64e8813c9b71a24c68Binarized Neural Networks: Training Deep Neural Networks with Weights and Activations Constrained to +1 or -1 "Courbariaux, Matthieu" "Hubara, Itay" "Soudry, Daniel" "El-Yaniv, Ran" "Bengio, Yoshua" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=66e684d89ae684bbbc4183a2ac7a3c46Deep Learning with Limited Numerical Precision "Gupta, Suyog" "Agrawal, Ankur" "Gopalakrishnan, Kailash" "Narayanan, Pritish" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3f60feb1803debc646650baaa40cb978EIE: Efficient Inference Engine on Compressed Deep Neural Network "Han, Song" "Liu, Xingyu" "Mao, Huizi" "Pu, Jing" "Pedram, Ardavan" "Horowitz, Mark A."
