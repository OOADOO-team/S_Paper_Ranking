name: MLC++: A Machine Learning Library in C++url: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2763748_MLC_A_Machine_Learning_Library_in_C?ev=prf_citpublic_in: Noneauthors: Ron Kohavi,George John,Richard Long,abstract: ABSTRACT  We present MLC++ , a library of C ++ classes and tools for supervised Machine Learning. While MLC++ provides general learning algorithms that can be used by end users, the main objective is to provide researchers and experts with a wide variety of tools that can accelerate algorithm development, increase software reliability, provide comparison tools, and display information visually. More than just a collection of existing algorithms, MLC++ is an attempt to extract commonalities of algorithms and decompose them for a unified view that is simple, coherent, and extensible. In this paper we discuss the problems MLC++ aims to solve, the design of MLC++ , and the current functionality. 1 Introduction Newton said he saw farther because he stood on the shoulders of giants.
