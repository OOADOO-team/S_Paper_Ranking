KLEINBRETELER,abstract: 1. The effect of benthivorous bream and carp on sediment resuspension and the concentrations of nutrients and chlorophyll a were studied in sixteen experimental ponds (mean depth 1m, mean area 0.1 ha, sandy clay/clay sediment), stocked with bream or carp at densities varying from 0 to 500 kg ha −1 . Planktivorous perch ( Perca fluviatilis L.) were added to some ponds to suppress zooplankton. 2. Suspended sediment concentrations increased linearly with biomass of benthivorous fish. Bream caused an increase of 46 g sediment m −2  day −1  per 100kg bream ha −1  and a reduction of 0.38m −1  in reciprocal Secchi disc depth, corresponding to an increase in the extinction coefficient of 0.34m −1 . 3. No relationship was found between size of fish and amount of resuspension, but the effect of bream was twice as great as that of carp. Benthivorous feeding was reduced in May because alternative food (zooplankton) was available. 4. Assuming a linear relationship, chlorophyll a level increased by 9.0 μgI −1 , total P by 0.03mgl −1  and Kjeldahl-N by 0.48mgl −1  per 100kg bream ha −1 . Silicate, chlorophyll a , total P and total N were all positively correlated with fish biomass, but orthophosphate showed no correlation.citations_number: 225Citation: Pathways of Increased Water Clarity After Fish Removal from Ventura Marsh; a Shallow, Eutrophic Wetland http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d8cb5d985cdb8469c583130736f9fa5fRole of sediment and internal loading of phosphorus in shallow lakes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dfa1a823e222ef5ae01ce48fa961cec1Restoration of shallow lakes by nutrient control and biomanipulation - The successful strategy varies with lake size and climate http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=87602d35ccf27cdd02f983636176ad3dBiomanipulation in shallow lakes in The Netherlands: an evaluation of 18 case studies http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=35a5e69357d41284c49ef9f457102503Predictions on the effect of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) exclusion on water quality, zooplankton, and submergent macrophytes in a Great Lakes wetland http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b5c34eac38b9344a3c928ed2624ac19Long\u2010term pattern of alternative stable states in two shallow eutrophic lakes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=96a8d4379a73cb07c4b89f4ddfbe5c36Laboratory studies on zooplankton\u00e2\u0080\u0090cyanobacteria interactions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d68bae28890841374e071a2e68cfe440Contrasting impacts of invasive engineers on freshwater ecosystems: an experiment and meta-analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c22d7fcc515f2e79be3c56a50fd16404Biomanipulation of lake ecosystems: successful applications and expanding complexity in the underlying science http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=98fac2bf62545642cb141be02d0c1f62Targeting global conservation funding to limit immediate biodiversity declines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3de68310c1b00363a882a2140b3e1d89References: Is reduction of the benthivorous fish an important cause of high transparency following biomanipulation in shallow lakes? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fa310303685d6c16e5a93765dbd56c1dThe influence of animals on phosphorus cycling in lake ecosystems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=966fcad35f87292f6e93a2f96ac41750The Influence of Animals on Phosphorus Cycling in Lake Ecosystems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=715e27719bc9755fc575b257edb2512fBiotic feedbacks in Lake phosphorus cycles. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=17730e54e4f485315874800ca505b3d8Resource Partitioning and Niche Shifts of Bream ( Abramis brama ) and Eel ( Anguilla anguilla ) Mediated by Predation of Smelt ( Osmerus eperlanus ) on Dap... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=efe5d37ee5c8e522e71a33b95e473f11Mechanisms for marine regime shifts: Can we use lakes as microcosms for oceans? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5aa12cb5b8224acdd7fd1226e5c22177
