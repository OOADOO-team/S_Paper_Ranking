name: Polymorphism in ornamental and common carp strains (Cyprinus carpio L.) as revealed by AFLP analysis and a new set of microsatellite markersurl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004380100569public_in: Springerauthors: David L.,Rajasekaran P.,Fang J.,abstract: Forty-seven new microsatellite markers were generated and applied, together with the AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) technique using two different enzyme combinations, to the genetic analysis of two carp species,  Cyprinus carpio  L. and  Ctenopharyngodon idella . The extent of polymorphism and the genetic relationships between nine carp populations were studied. The incidence of microsatellites containing CA and CT motifs was estimated to be one every 17.4 and one every 126.3Â kb, respectively, and their average allele numbers were four and five, respectively. Across populations, the average proportion of individuals that were heterozygous for microsatellite markers was 44.2% and the average allele number was 4.02. The  Eco RI/ Taq I combination generated more analyzable AFLP bands than the  Eco RI/ Mse I pair, making the former preferable for the analysis of carp populations. The proportion of polymorphic AFLP bands within populations ranged from 6.7% in grass carp to 59.9% in Kohaku strain (Koi) of the ornamental carp. The fixation index (F ST ) for microsatellites in these populations was estimated to be 0.37, and for AFLP markers the value was 0.39. Genetic distance matrices derived from microsatellites and from two AFLP analyses were positively correlated. Grass carp showed fewer AFLP bands than other populations and was genotyped by only half of the microsatellite markers. These findings agree with genetic distance estimates in suggesting that the grass carp is phylogenetically quite remote from all the other populations examined.citations_number: 196Citation: THE POPULATION BIOLOGY OF INVASIVE SPECIES http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7b70eeb9f50098a9b5e502091d4696c6DNA marker technologies and their applications in aquaculture genetics http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4a63e3e6c8c7c06cce9eb676e3352d7cAn Evolutionary and Applied Perspective of Insect Biotypes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=29a3bef00aa5eb7e182cea541e21df59Invasion biology of thrips. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b57f97a6297eaaf350e325371cedc0fdThe evolutionary consequences of biological invasions. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=28d53baa79322ab91e6add52a8e04c85Seasonal and within plant distribution of Frankliniella thrips (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) in North Florida tomatoes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0befba5c54e8b4c0c06b20c34a73342dRecent Duplication of the Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio L.)
