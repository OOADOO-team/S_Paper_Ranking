name: Mass mortalities in Koi carp, Cyprinus carpio, associated with gill and skin disease.url: http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20002205933.htmlpublic_in: CAB Directauthors: Bretzinger, A,FischerScherl, T,Oumouna, M,abstract: ABSTRACT  In 1997 two and in 1998 six cases of mass mortality in Koi carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) with similar symptoms were examined. Gross examination revealed in each of the cases moderate to extensive epidermal lesions, gill necrosis and enopthalmus. Different ectoparasites were found on the skin only in low numbers, on the gills slight to heavy infestations, mainly with protozoan parasites encountered. Pathological anatomy revealed pale internal organs and an enlarged anterior kidney. Different opportunistic bacteria were isolated from inner organs, with Aeromonas sobria in 7/8 cases. Cohabitation trials confirm the infectious nature of the disease to different breeds of Cyprinus carpio. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the presence of virus-like particles in the nuclei and cytoplasm of respiratory epithelial cells of gills.citations_number: 117Citation: Genome Sequences of Three Koi Herpesvirus Isolates Representing the Expanding Distribution of an Emerging Disease Threatening Koi and Common Carp Worldwide http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d79ecf195782408e4e6f27a779febb39Koi herpesvirus represents a third cyprinid herpesvirus (CyHV-3) in the family Herpesviridae. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b463d1f2481ebab17f8c16ea8aafe78dConcentrations of a Koi herpesvirus (KHV) in tissues of experimentally infected Cyprinus carpio koi as assessed by real-time TaqMan PCR. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=18266ffcbe981398c9d03f34e8e6e9a3Efficient vaccine against the virus causing a lethal disease in cultured Cyprinus carpio. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=54a3d745c97e95867c8892c044f85ce1Initial characteristics of koi herpesvirus and development of a polymerase chain reaction assay to detect the virus in koi, Cyprinus carpio koi. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cf766647dcdf0b19c97f17202a6aa817The emergence of koi herpesvirus and its significance to European aquaculture. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4d0c308f78d1375b64f9bd66fcde12b8Cloning of the koi herpesvirus (KHV) gene encoding thymidine kinase and its use for a highly sensitive PCR based diagnosis. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3866c92183e0d41d4522ac84756da672Viruses of Lower Vertebrates http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=64a454561cca9ce4a5437df0852ac87bAn inexpensive and rapid diagnostic method of Koi Herpesvirus (KHV) infection by loop-mediated isothermal amplification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a7ca3218a9846cfb57487951ab501e31Detection of carp interstitial nephritis and gill necrosis virus in fish droppings http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f699c57df656c12e029e41c48a199ae0References:
