name: A Herpesvirus Associated with Mass Mortality of Juvenile and Adult Koi, a Strain of Common Carpurl: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28880775public_in: NCBIauthors: R.P.Hedrick,O.Gilad,S.Yun,abstract: A herpesvirus was isolated from adult koi, a strain of common carp Cyprinus carpio, suffering mass mortality in two outbreaks—one in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States and the second in Israel. The principal external signs of dying fish were pale and irregularly colored gills. There were few consistent internal signs in either outbreak. The most prominent microscopic lesions were in the gills, where hyperplasia and necrosis of the epithelium were severe. Other lesions included interstitial nephritis, splenitis, and enteritis. Affected cells often contained nuclei with marginated chromatin and faint intranuclear inclusions. Typical herpesvirus particles were present in branchial epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and among circulating leukocytes. Inoculations of the koi fin (KF-1) cell line with tissue extracts from the gill and kidney–spleen resulted in cytopathic effects characterized by severe vacuolation first detected after 7 d incubation at 20°C. Exposures of adult koi to the herpesvirus as propagated in KF-1 cells by bath or intraperitoneal injections resulted in 80–100% mortality during a 26-d period, and the virus was reisolated from the gill, kidney, liver, spleen, intestine, and brain of dead fish. The viral agents from koi in Israel and the United States appear to be similar if not identical; both could be distinguished from Herpesvirus cyprini by indirect fluorescent antibody tests with rabbit anti-H. cyprini serum. Other factors should be examined but we strongly suspect that this newly recognized koi herpesvirus (KHV) has the potential to be a significant cause of mortality among koi and presumably common carp.citations_number: 338Citation: Genome Sequences of Three Koi Herpesvirus Isolates Representing the Expanding Distribution of an Emerging Disease Threatening Koi and Common Carp Worldwide http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d79ecf195782408e4e6f27a779febb39Koi herpesvirus represents a third cyprinid herpesvirus (CyHV-3) in the family Herpesviridae. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b463d1f2481ebab17f8c16ea8aafe78dParasites and marine invasions. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8e0d5f52109e76b46b208ac5350c5d33Concentrations of a Koi herpesvirus (KHV) in tissues of experimentally infected Cyprinus carpio koi as assessed by real-time TaqMan PCR. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=18266ffcbe981398c9d03f34e8e6e9a3Efficient vaccine against the virus causing a lethal disease in cultured Cyprinus carpio. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=54a3d745c97e95867c8892c044f85ce1Initial characteristics of koi herpesvirus and development of a polymerase chain reaction assay to detect the virus in koi, Cyprinus carpio koi. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cf766647dcdf0b19c97f17202a6aa817The emergence of koi herpesvirus and its significance to European aquaculture. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4d0c308f78d1375b64f9bd66fcde12b8Emerging viral diseases of fish and shrimp http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a5379bf24ab61e351c5f9ba49a1552d7Molecular comparison of isolates of an emerging fish pathogen, koi herpesvirus, and the effect of water temperature on mortality of experimentally infected... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=00c9f1d057677064b1d314fab3d7a2d3Pathogenesis of Acute Viral Disease Induced in Fish by Carp Interstitial Nephritis and Gill Necrosis Virus http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c7498c78a57442ce69734825af9fada8References: Some properties of the Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cell line from carp cyprinus carpio http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d1b8a2380bac678df6cdd26475fdbca1Fish viruses and fish viral diseases. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bb8bfa3e335a1c68d989609965de2660Blue book: suggested procedures for the detection and identification of certain finfish and shellfish pathogens.
