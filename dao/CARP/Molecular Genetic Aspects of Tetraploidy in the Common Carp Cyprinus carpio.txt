name: Molecular Genetic Aspects of Tetraploidy in the Common Carp Cyprinus carpiourl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1055790384710074public_in: Elsevierauthors: Dan Larhammar, Carl Risinger,abstract: Genome duplications are believed to have occurred on multiple occasions in vertebrate evolution. Studies of duplicate gene loci in tetraploid animals may reveal important general aspects of gene duplication, an important mode of gene evolution in metazoans. The common carp Cyprinus carpio has twice as many chromosomes as most other cyprinid fishes due to tetraploidization previously estimated to have occurred 50 Myr ago. Our sequence analyses of duplicate carp loci suggest that the tetraploidization took place less than 16 Myr ago. This is further supported by sequence comparisons with the diploid grass carp, which seems to have diverged from the common carp approximately 19 Myr ago. Duplicate loci appear to remain expressed for millions of years and may accumulate mutations leading to drastic amino acid replacements as shown here for somatotropin. Therefore, both loci should always be characterized in molecular studies of tetraploid animals such as goldfish, salmonid fishes, and Xenopus laevis. The long life of duplicate genes may explain the occurrence of numerous large multigene families in higher metazoans.citations_number: 176Citation: Zebrafish Comparative Genomics and the Origins of Vertebrate Chromosomes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c6137bfe13f6aeca650e0bf75ccf282dA Comparative Map of the Zebrafish Genome http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c8c82494dc7e083cb22874fe04ce6f41Subfunction partitioning, the teleost radiation and the annotation of the human genome http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6201676a6b6d504fbf6955733e5f1e89Regulation of fish gonadotropins. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=95ff28a030bb8fbf97464fb83edd6e68\u9ca4\u9c7c\u7684\u9057\u4f20\u8fde\u9501\u56fe\u8c31(\u521d\u62a5) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6844bb68fbb634c7e7a1b8722b86729dPhylogeny of the Acipenseriformes: cytogenetic and molecular approaches http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=520cadaa92f41c4965aa78d5d559482fDevelopmental Roles of Pufferfish Hox Clusters and Genome Evolution in Ray-Fin Fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b01d57b092cd80dcda097a4a0be39e31&lsquo;Why polyploidy is rarer in animals than in plants&rsquo;: myths and mechanisms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b03258faf3e74c992b9129299d82d123Recent Duplication of the Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio L.)
