name: Hypoxia induces adaptive and reversible gross morphological changes in crucian carp gillsurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM12966058public_in: 万方authors: Jørund Sollid,Paula De Angelis,Kristian Gundersen,abstract: We show that crucian carp (Carassius carassius) living in normoxic (aerated) water have gills that lack protruding lamellae, the primary site of O2 uptake in fish. Such an unusual trait leads to a very small respiratory surface area. Histological examination showed that the lamellae (secondary lamellae) of these fish were embedded in a cell mass (denoted embedded lamellae). When the fish were kept in hypoxic water, a large reduction in this cell mass occurred, making the lamellae protrude and increasing the respiratory surface area by ∼7.5-fold. This morphological change was found to be reversible and was caused by increased apoptosis combined with reduced cell proliferation. Carp with protruding lamellae had a higher capacity for oxygen uptake at low oxygen levels than fish with embedded lamellae, but water and ion fluxes appeared to be increased, which indicates increased osmoregulatory costs. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of an adaptive and reversible gross morphological change in the respiratory organ of an adult vertebrate in response to changes in the availability of oxygen.citations_number: 226Citation: Oxygen-dependent gene expression in fishes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7f835f1276f3498ab6b71e447e950a9aHypoxic survival strategies in two fishes: extreme anoxia tolerance in the North European crucian carp and natural hypoxic preconditioning in a coral-reef ... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3126d0276c177cc35c31333d8905a086Gene expression profiling of the long-term adaptive response to hypoxia in the gills of adult zebrafish. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=139d5d5cc17bd9dfbdd679cae87bbce6Plasticity of respiratory structures--adaptive remodeling of fish gills induced by ambient oxygen and temperature. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3bc7f8229639131e0be34994eda647b1Gill remodeling in fish--a new fashion or an ancient secret? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=00f860355557d5caa827f2359a76a6bcTemperature regulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in apoikilothermic vertebrate, crucian carp (Carassius carassius) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bb30b23270c9f9c321bd40b0143c1422Temperature alters the respiratory surface area of crucian carp Carassius carassius and goldfish Carassius auratus http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5dd2cf9db3616cc189195930f80f8af5Atmospheric oxygen level and the evolution of insect body size http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6c862f61767780fcaa94724c46b8cef8Does size matter for hypoxia tolerance in fish? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3aad22ce248ed5962ad34f318ab8a3c4Hypoxia and the antipredator behaviours of fishes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=28402854fb766215dc4783b14821b3f2References: How should salinity influence fish growth? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=abc5897ada0075c35ae538a487a6cad3Morphology of gill epithelia in fish. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e8a3590bc6ee2a015d579c19bd9cc947Surviving Anoxia With the Brain Turned On http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=23f26f4590e65591d5fb03fdb3729228Anaerobic wintering of crucian carp ( Carassius carassius L.)-I.
