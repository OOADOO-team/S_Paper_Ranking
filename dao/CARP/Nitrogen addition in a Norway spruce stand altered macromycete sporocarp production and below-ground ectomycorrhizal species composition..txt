name: Nitrogen addition in a Norway spruce stand altered macromycete sporocarp production and below-ground ectomycorrhizal species composition.url: http://www.jstor.org/stable/3186183public_in: JSTORauthors: Peter M,Ayer F,Egli S,abstract: Abstract        â¢    Changes in above- and below-ground ectomycorrhizal species composition are reported following nitrogen addition for 2 yr to a subalpine spruce ( Picea abies ) stand.        â¢    The macrofungal sporocarp production was recorded before and during N addition. Belowground ectomycorrhizal diversity was measured by PCR-RFLP analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA extracted from single mycorrhizal root tips before, and after 1 and 2 yr of fertilization.        â¢    Sporocarp surveys showed that diversity of the ectomycorrhizal community was drastically reduced following 1 yr of N addition, whereas the saprobic fungal community was not affected. The impact on belowground ectomycorrhizal diversity was less pronounced with no change either in the number of ectomycorrhizal taxa or in Simpson&#039;s index of diversity. However, a change in belowground species composition 2 years after N addition was observed with significant changes in abundances of single species.        â¢    Species which produced large sporocarps accounted for 25% of all sampled root tips. At least 44% of all ectomycorrhizas were formed by species belonging to the Thelephoraceae and Corticiaceae, taxa which produce inconspicuous sporocarps.        â¢    Addition of N caused a shift in ectomycorrhizal abundance from species forming large sporocarps to species with no or resupinate sporocarps.citations_number: 287Citation: The molecular revolution in ectomycorrhizal ecology: peeking into the black-box. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=26a814f6fc658667ce7d985d54cbfafcBelowground Ectomycorrhizal Fungal Community Change Over a Nitrogen Deposition Gradient in Alaska http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=33d45beb028ea2930a9d738dcb3c0fc5454 Pyrosequencing analyses of forest soils reveal an unexpectedly high fungal diversity http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7ab6d07076631ca8aef86561ca11399bChronic nitrogen enrichment affects the structure and function of the soil microbial community in temperate hardwood and pine forests http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e69573c8de659c6c6acb7f81e8a13e07Nitrogen additions and microbial biomass: a meta-analysis of ecosystem studies. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=065b897303711ff4409b670e94571431Dahlberg A..
