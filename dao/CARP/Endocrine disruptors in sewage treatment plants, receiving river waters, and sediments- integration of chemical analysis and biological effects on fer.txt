name: Endocrine disruptors in sewage treatment plants, receiving river waters, and sediments: integration of chemical analysis and biological effects on feral carpurl: http://www.bioone.org/servlet/linkout?suffix=bibr45&amp;dbid=8&amp;doi=10.4003%2F006.030.0208&amp;key=12371491public_in: BioOneauthors: Petrovic M,Solé M,López de Alda MJ,abstract: Occurrence of alkylphenol ethoxylates or their metabolites (alkylphenols and carboxylated derivatives), as well as natural and synthetic steroids in sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents and in their receiving waters, has been related to biological effects, measured as alterations of plasma vitellogenin (VTG) concentration in natural fish populations. Water composites of STP influents, effluents, sludge, river water, sediment, and feral carps  (Cyprinus carpio)  were analyzed over a seven-month period in two tributaries of the Llobregat River (NE Spain). Solid-phase extraction/liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (SPE-LC-MS) analysis revealed concentrations of up to 31 g/L for nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEOs), 15 g/L for nonylphenol (NP), and 35 g/L for nonylphenoxy carboxylate (NPE1C) in river water downstream of STPs. These compounds were also found to accumulate in river sediment with concentrations ranging from 10 to 820 g/kg of NPEOs and from 22 to 645 g/kg for NP. Natural and synthetic estrogens and progestogens also occurred in the water and sediments analyzed but in the ng/L and g/kg range, respectively. Vitellogenin fluctuated among sites and sampling periods, but it was found to be increased in male carp collected downstream of the main STP. A correlation between endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) in water and sediment and plasma VTG concentration in male carp was observed, especially for alkylphenolic compounds in water and sediment samples ( r  = 0.83-0.84 for  n  = 24) and for estriol and estrone in water ( r  =0.78 and 0.94 for  n  = 9 and 8, respectively).citations_number: 351Citation: Environmental mass spectrometry: emerging contaminants and current issues. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d6b35e3073761c9595ea0e4916dbe36Nonylphenol in the environment: a critical review on occurrence, fate, toxicity and treatment in wastewaters http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4a2a629dc2edea92ae34cc8b73cc2e53An integrated assessment of estrogenic contamination and biological effects in the aquatic environment of The Netherlands http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fcfe5d37c575b9fe302e887d468a9e29Endocrine disrupting compounds removal from wastewater, a new challenge http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d9b0ff7267b8141054c4c2eeec3091e3Analysis and occurrence of pharmaceuticals, estrogens, progestogens and polar pesticides in sewage treatment plant effluents, river water and drinking wate... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f69d0bcb515d7e66f402ad68641e6c75Liquid chromatography-(tandem) mass spectrometry of selected emerging pollutants (steroid sex hormones, drugs and alkylphenolic surfactants) in the aquatic... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=138e3d20a61f3c7c2f9ae9ed0fc4134cAnalysis and distribution of estrogens and progestogens in sewage sludge, soils and sediments http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8b20f226140ccd24ec49f75038da3496Endocrine disrupting compounds and other emerging contaminants in the environment: A survey on new monitoring strategies and occurrence data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=140b612425f97a2d2bdd08db8812bab8Distribution of endocrine disruptors in the Llobregat River basin (Catalonia, NE Spain). http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=734e057b7aeece468152f27a50f7befaEffect-directed analysis of key toxicants in European river basins a review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8650ad7d1252641ecb1fd0be74b1f986References: Identification of estrogenic chemicals in STW effluent. 1.
