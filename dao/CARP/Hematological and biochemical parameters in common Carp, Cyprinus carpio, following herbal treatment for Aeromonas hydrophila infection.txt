name: Hematological and biochemical parameters in common Carp, Cyprinus carpio, following herbal treatment for Aeromonas hydrophila infectionurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848603000231public_in: Elsevierauthors: R Harikrishnan,M Nisha Rani,C Balasundaram,abstract: The common carp, Cyprinus carpio was injected 10 8 cfu/ml with a strain of the Gram-negative bacterium, Aeromonas hydrophila. After inoculation, the disease signs began on the 7th day as a haemorrhagic spot at the site of injection and the lesion subsequently progressed in size. After this period, the mortality of infected group was 10±5% daily; hence, they were dip treated with an aqueous Azadirachta indica leaf extract at 1 g/l for 10 min daily for 30 days until the lesions healed completely. The hematological and biochemical parameters of the infected and control fishes were monitored on the 10th, 20th and 30th day. The white blood cell (WBCs: 10 4 mm −3) counts significantly increased from 3.15±0.14 in control fish to 3.6±0.20 on the 10th day of treatment ( P&lt;0.01) and only in treated fish ( P&gt;0.05) on the 30th day. The red blood cell (RBC: 10 6 mm −3) counts also significantly decreased to 1.68±0.12 on the 10th day ( P&lt;0.001) when compared to the control fish (2.31±0.16). The hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit/packed cell volume (PCV) counts decreased significantly from 10.37±0.61 and 33.60±3.20 in the infected fish to 6.21±0.60 and 20.30±3.8 in the treated fish on the 10th day and this value attained a normal level on the 30th day. On the 10th day of treatment, the serum protein level significantly ( P&lt;0.01) increased from 3.34±1.32 in controls compared to 3.61±0.96 in treated fishes. It subsequently remained high but attained near normal ( P&gt;0.05) values on the 30th day. In infected fishes the values continued to decrease significantly from 2.76±0.69 on the 10th day to 2.38±0.39 on the 30th day. Serum glucose, cholesterol and serum calcium levels were significantly lower in control fishes (119±16.93, 10.00±1.39 and 4.88±0.34) compared to treated fishes (77.63±15.57, 6.11±1.55 and 3.62±0.39) on the 10th day of treatment. In the infected fishes, the values continued to decrease significantly from the 10th day (64.6±11.97, 4.37±1.39 and 3.30±0.46) and by the 30th day reached 56.10±9.56, 4.31±0.91 and 2.88±0.52, respectively.citations_number: 228Citation: Immunomodulatory effects of dietary intake of chitin, chitosan and levamisole on the immune system of Cyprinus carpio and control of Aeromonas hydrophila i... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a304d3605b1f3cce0f0795c977fee6dcEffect of Achyranthes aspera on the immunity and survival of Labeo rohita infected with Aeromonas hydrophila http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f5cf5acedd333358be8d3cdcea53f4e8Does size matter for hypoxia tolerance in fish? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3aad22ce248ed5962ad34f318ab8a3c4Daily and seasonal variations in haematological and blood biochemical parameters in the tench, Tinca tinca Linnaeus, 1758. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ae2ea647f5f1552aa591ecd3ad0241dfEffects of the probiotic, Lactobacillus acidophilus, on the growth performance, haematology parameters and immunoglobulin concentration in African Catfish ... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bbcb974bd124c405f581dd66a7ccaa1fHaematological changes in Nile tilapia experimentally infected with Enterococcus sp.
