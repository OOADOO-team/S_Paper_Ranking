name: Chinese herbs (Astragalus radix and Ganoderma lucidum) enhance immune response of carp, Cyprinus carpio, and protection against Aeromonas hydrophilaurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1050464808001939public_in: Elsevierauthors: Guojun Yin,L Ard√≥,K.D. Thompson,abstract: The effect of Chinese herbs (Aeromonas salmonicidaThe results of this study showed that feeding non-vaccinated and vaccinated carp with combination of Astragalus and Ganoderma stimulated respiratory burst activity, phagocytosis of phagocytic cells in blood and lysozyme and circulatory antibody titres in plasma in vaccinated carp. Fish challenged with A. hydrophila had variable survival. The best survival (60%) was in vaccinated group fed with both herbs, while almost 90% of control fish (negative control) and 60% of fish vaccinated only (positive control) died.citations_number: 186Citation: Immunological control of fish diseases. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cd6a01e580ea97c730c4352369c63028Impact of plant products on innate and adaptive immune system of cultured finfish and shellfish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3f8e3518867b0d47817ea95204f25214The use of immunostimulating herbs in fish.
