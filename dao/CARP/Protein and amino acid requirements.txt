name: Protein and amino acid requirementsurl: http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-7918-8_6public_in: Springerauthors: A.G.J. Tacon,C.B. Cowey,abstract: Over the past 25 years, considerable progress has been made in the study of the dietary nutrient requirements of fishes (for reviews see Cowey &amp; Sargent, 1972, 1979; Halver, 1972; National Research Council, 1981, 1983; and Millikin, 1982). Despite some obvious similarities between fishes and other vertebrates in basic qualitative nutrient needs, the two groups have markedly different quantitative nutrient requirements. For example, the optimal dietary protein level required for maximal growth in farmed fishes is reported to be 50–300% higher than that of terrestrial farm animals (Cowey, 1975). In the main, these quantitative differences have been attributed to the carnivorous/omnivorous feeding habit of fishes and their apparent preferential use of protein over carbohydrate as a dietary energy source. However, the common expression by nutritionists (including major review authors) of nutrient requirements solely in terms of a ‘dietary percentage’ has itself limited value unless it is related to the feed intake and subsequent growth of the animal. This chapter attempts to relate the protein and amino acid requirements of fishes to the ‘growing animal’ with respect to its dietary feeding regime, developmental status, position in the aquatic food chain, and its physical environment. In addition, this chapter critically assesses the methodology employed by researchers for the measurement of nutrient requirements.citations_number: 239Citation: Soybean and lupin seed meals as protein sources in diets for gilthead seabream ( Sparus aurata ): nutritional and histological implications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c01dc435cccd6537978387e9788e97bbProtein and amino acid requirements of fishes. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=99c1ce60e8a343db21befc3a752c8f1dDietary fiber, amino acid, fatty acid and tocopherol contents of the edible seaweeds Ulva lactuca and Durvillaea antarctica http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=50c1673dddeb3dd7f4cd0e3e5fa52aaaFirst feeding of marine fish larvae: Are free amino acids the source of energy? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=21e34ac2fd2ffc195bb72d8e45c59b2eCatastrophic response of lakes to benthivorous fish introduction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5a50cc717d4671976413f08aa83eb9d5Dietary phosphorus requirement of large yellow croaker, Pseudosciaena crocea R \u2606 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1660eba9388cce4324d84f7382a3c4b0Replacement of fish meal by rendered animal protein ingredients with lysine and methionine supplementation to practical diets for gibel carp, Carassius aur... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ff5b6cdbfad5cdf1e6efbdf91f53fd6dProteomic sensitivity to dietary manipulations in rainbow trout http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4207ce2ddfc2285f8c7a21c33fb0c48bDietary lysine requirement of juvenile Japanese seabass, Lateolabrax japonicus http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1ef153b95e8dd3bff28370f6f2092721Effects of feeding frequency and dietary moisture content on growth, body composition and gastric evacuation of juvenile Korean rockfish ( Sebastes schlege... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fa24164b4981493ecbe432c52239cdd4References: 6\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Physiological Energetics http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5ab95ffe6465f55ac96843386d0e993eGrowth Rate and Body Composition of Fingerling Sockeye Salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, in relation to Temperature and Ration Size http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d4453143e2a8872bb118f0d6ccc388f2Interactions of dietary levels of protein and energy on channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=87e78d6245c05c1c9929926d4f07a7f9Nutrient requirements of warmwater fishes and shellfishes Revised edition.
