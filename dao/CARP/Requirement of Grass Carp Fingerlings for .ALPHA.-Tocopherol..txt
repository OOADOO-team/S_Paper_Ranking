name: Requirement of Grass Carp Fingerlings for .ALPHA.-Tocopherol.url: http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/19931457668.htmlpublic_in: CAB Directauthors: Takeuchi, Toshio, Watanabe, Kyoumi, Satoh, Shuichi,abstract: Vitamin E deficiency symptoms and requirement of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) for α-tocopherol were studied. Grass carp fingerlings, 4.5 g, were fed on diets containing α-tocopherol 0 to 50 mg/100 g for 15 weeks. Fish fed on α-tocopherol deficient diet showed &#039;sekoke disease&#039;, a similar symptom to apparent muscular dystrophy of carp, characterized by a marked loss of flesh in the back, ...citations_number: 211Citation: Lipid nutrition of marine fish during early development: current status and future directions. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=54384ebf781841ec7844cea626fd2fceApparent protein digestibility and mineral availabilities in various feed ingredients for salmonid feeds. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=21db354de7a8585f090ac432d8577e91Fatty acid requirements in ontogeny of marine and freshwater fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=21f12f1a31c909856591a883aad404c4Prospects in larval fish dietetics. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0d1da13f21eda591dfd3eba690a67ddcRequirement criteria for essential fatty acids. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1fa6ddd48b6118a23447917b1a7ea6fbPolyunsaturated fatty acids in marine bacteria \u2014 a dogma rewritten http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=70e8fc956ccab738e92e862f7c213f77Review on the dietary effects of phospholipids in fish and crustacean larviculture http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=81e85599fc864bb51795622e0abcbff4Recent advances in lipid nutrition in fish larvae. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d798839d5458e5ebed4a614f95daa9aThe role of phospholipids in nutrition and metabolism of teleost fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=880a270c9c2104edae04fbeb19a81d43Strategies for further development of aquatic feeds http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ec0a257fa7936f78c859347ecade2149References:
