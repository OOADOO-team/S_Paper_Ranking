name: Cold-Induced Expression of Delta9-Desaturase in Carp by Transcriptional and Posttranslational Mechanismsurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM8629000public_in: 万方authors: Tiku, P. E., Gracey, A. Y., Macartney, A. I.,abstract: Poikilothermic animals respond to chronic cold by increasing phosphoglyceride unsaturation to restore the fluidity of cold-rigidified membranes. Despite the importance of this compensatory response, the enzymes involved have not been clearly identified, and the mechanisms that control their activity are unknown. In carp liver, cold induces an 8- to 10-fold increase in specific activity of the microsomal stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase. Cold-induced up-regulation of gene transcription resulted in a 10-fold increase in desaturase transcript amounts after 48 to 60 hours. However, this increase was preceded by the activation of latent desaturase, probably by a posttranslational mechanism. These two mechanisms may act sequentially to match desaturase expression to the demands imposed by a progressive decrease in temperature.citations_number: 273Citation: Metabolism and Functions of Lipids and Fatty Acids in Teleost Fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d3d049c4c92732390d972ffb4ceefcaeClimate variations and the physiological basis of temperature dependent biogeography: systemic to molecular hierarchy of thermal tolerance in animals. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=15d8668b2baac4422e75d1f545bfa7e3Seasonal Acclimatization of the Carp Involves Differential Expression of 5.8S Ribosomal RNA in Pituitary Cells - improving the sensitivity of progressive m... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3e3b0fe7a12af654fab9ed34c22f37caStructure, function, and dietary regulation of delta6, delta5, and delta9 desaturases. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e83ed27c9dc650b3c3ee1d790a3417a1Regulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturases and role in metabolism. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=32f897c8c330409731e4f19085ec2ab9Structure and expression of fatty acid desaturases http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2674410ee8e9852f31995767744e4126Membrane fluidity and its roles in the perception of environmental signals http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=03da99281f47928f64505d782410a220Membrane Fluidity and Temperature Perception http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c41962cb6f673050067fb3fa907cb20aRole of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase in regulating lipid metabolism. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d28ec8c3daaf7ec67ff2384205fd2777Cold shock and adaptation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cbfd944a5a223adbdaec81fae29110adReferences: Cartilage and diarthrodial joints as paradigms for hierarchical materials and structures. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8bfe08a9d4f54dca239dd40091cee449Thermal Adaptation in Biological Membranes: Is Homeoviscous Adaptation the Explanation? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2ee2fefb39ae523875bc5ae005883c31Excess of metalloproteases over tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease may contribute to cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c781bdee2784b335e787552862f9ed49CARTILAGE OLIGOMERIC MATRIX PROTEIN: A NOVEL MARKER OF CARTILAGE TURNOVER DETECTABLE IN SYNOVIAL FLUID AND BLOOD http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=89b237486719a42170cf7dd3e0a2cfbcThermal adaptation in biological membranes: Functional significance of changes in phospholipid molecular species composition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=18122704ddce55b7baa3134eddd8e797Mechanism of rat liver microsomal stearyl-CoA desaturase.
