name: Adjuvant vinorelbine plus cisplatin versus observation in patients with completely resected stage IB–IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer (Adjuvant Navelbine International Trialist Association [ANITA]): a randomised controlled trialurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S147020450670804Xpublic_in: Elsevierauthors: Jean-Yves Douillard,Rafael Rosell,Mario De Lena,abstract: Whether adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is not known. We aimed to compare the effect of adjuvant vinorelbine plus cisplatin versus observation on survival in patients with completely resected NSCLC. 840 patients with stage IB–IIIA NSCLC from 101 centres in 14 countries were randomly assigned to observation (n=433) or to 30 mg/m 2 vinorelbine plus 100 mg/m 2 cisplatin (n=407). Postoperative radiotherapy was not mandatory and was undertaken according to every centre&#039;s policy. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN95053737. 367 patients in the chemotherapy group and 431 in the control group received their assigned treatment. 301 (36%) patients had stage IB disease, 203 (24%) had stage II disease, and 325 (39%) had stage IIIA disease. Tolerance to chemotherapy mainly included neutropenia in 335 (92%) patients and febrile neutropenia in 34 (9%); seven (2%) toxic deaths were also recorded. Compliance was greater with cisplatin than with vinorelbine (median dose intensity 89% [range 17–108] vs 59% [17–100]). After a median follow-up of 76 months (range 43–116), median survival was 65·7 months (95% CI 47·9–88·5) in the chemotherapy group and 43·7 (35·7–52·3) months in the observation group. Adjusted risk for death was significantly reduced in patients assigned chemotherapy compared with controls (hazard ratio 0·80 [95% CI 0·66–0·96]; p=0·017). Overall survival at 5 years with chemotherapy improved by 8·6%, which was maintained at 7 years (8·4%). Adjuvant vinorelbine plus cisplatin extends survival in patients with completely resected NSCLC, better defining indication of adjuvant chemotherapy.citations_number: 1094Citation: Identification of the transforming EML4-ALK fusion gene in non-small-cell lung cancer. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=21e7a6bcf7bc1834b2ef82d8520b82cdThe IASLC Lung Cancer Staging Project: proposals for the revision of the TNM stage groupings in the forthcoming (seventh) edition of the TNM Classification... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2332ce8f1e34342b1087872d359069ccImpact of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A Expression, Thrombospondin-2 Expression, and Microvessel Density on the Treatment Effect of Bevacizumab in M... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7dc7e588bbb076bcd9026f20c246162dIdentification of novel isoforms of the EML4-ALK transforming gene in non-small cell lung cancer http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dbaca1fe1bd0b3e0aeccf7effc9b787aActivating mutations in ALK provide a therapeutic target in neuroblastoma http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=65ec683d676ed69df1141bf0c3385aceNon-solid oncogenes in solid tumors: EML4-ALK fusion genes in lung cancer. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d4ea90c0a5160d17dc597dbb338ff8e8Effectiveness of Specialized Palliative Care: A Systematic Review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=21af40d63c05de59b5ce7880ee0e9effA meta-analysis of diabetes mellitus and the risk of prostate cancer http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=78345cad6acd6f6bff1708509d505fd2Lung adjuvant cisplatin evaluation: a pooled analysis by the LACE Collaborative Group. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bdc6cb309b4a9f4fb1dbf3d443c08f0aReferences: Combined 5-fluorouracil and supervoltage radiation therapy of locally unresectable gastrointestinal cancer. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=59804500514502e646a7583479db1365Molecular Biology of Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase\u2013Positive Anaplastic Large-Cell Lymphoma http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4a6016ebccc2584e19f146cb0cd570c9Predicting the Clinical Status of Human Breast Cancer by Using Gene Expression Profiles http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4154dbe7602c2820d1addc8fc0b2a19dActivity of gefitinib in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with very poor performance status. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=96a15e40531e117e0b3247b399b66460Cisplatin-based therapy for elderly patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: implications of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 5592, a randomize... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=34b8e740231195d633bcf4826eafbfbfVinorelbine plus Cisplatin vs. Observation in Resected Non\u2013Small-Cell Lung Cancer http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=19ad329fe004310acdd105fa51886b0cPostoperative radiotherapy in nonsmall-cell lung cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data from nine randomised controlled trials http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=645217ab96f9e91249154574e4439f13Intensive postremission chemotherapy in adults with acute myeloid leukemia.
