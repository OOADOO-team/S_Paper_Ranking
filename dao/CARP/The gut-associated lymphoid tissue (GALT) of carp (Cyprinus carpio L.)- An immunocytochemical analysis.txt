name: The gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) of carp (Cyprinus carpio L.): An immunocytochemical analysisurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0145305X9390015Ipublic_in: Elsevierauthors: Jan H.W.M. Rombout,Anja J. TaverneThiele,Maria I. Villena,abstract: Abstract The GALT of carp was studied with monoclonal antibodies reacting with carp Ig or carp leukocytes, using (dual) immunofluorescence or immunogold staining on cryosections, cytocentrifuge slides, and cell suspensions of the intestine. The intestinal epithelium contained many Ig-negative lymphoid cells and, in the hindgut, also many large Ig-positive macrophages, which appeared to bind Ig. The lamina propria contained numerous Ig-positive lymphoid cells next to Ig-negative lymphoid cells and granulocytes. Leukocytes isolated from the intestine mainly consisted of Ig-negative lymphoid cells (&gt; 90%). With the methods used, leukocytes were poorly released from the connective tissue. Nevertheless, two types of Ig-containing cells were found: a conventional plasma cell, frequently showing Ig at its surface, and a more common smaller lymphoid cell having a narrow rim of Ig-positive cytoplasm but hardly any Ig on its surface. Many of the Ig-positive lymphoid cells observed in the lamina propria may represent these small Ig-containing cells. Isolated Ig-positive macrophages were frequently associated with B- and T-like cells. Our data strongly suggests an immunological function for the gut of carp, especially for the antigen-transporting hindgut.citations_number: 255Citation: Transplantation and in vivo imaging of multilineage engraftment in zebrafish bloodless mutants. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d67bbcbe6ab8e8769ae73df1395a706dProbiotics and immunity: a fish perspective http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=490f510ad164842b7a3367b1d777a2deBacterial Interactions in Early Life Stages of Marine Cold Water Fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=151b0fec11c0ca1f5de1156df370b71fIgT, a primitive immunoglobulin class specialized in mucosal immunity http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=29ccaa712e2f9b4cadfc6bf7ae3d2dbfOntogeny of the immune system of fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=69b21a2a1452a308ba9d8a93df2f0e9cThe innate immune response of finfish \u2013 A review of current knowledge http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b5bd68b85b8bce5823d7acc745fbe61dNon\u2010specific defence mechanisms in fish, with particular reference to the reticuloendothelial system (RES) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3bb803a2ba417f871fdba767036d95dbDifferences in mucus and serum immunoglobulin of carp ( Cyprinus carpio L.) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a2b0077639b01ec684f41fa84873b3fd\u9c7c\u7c7b\u514d\u75ab\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6982\u51b5 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0364fe56a3e89ac72134bfad0f65be53The intestines of carnivorous fish: structure and functions and the relations with diet. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9777c941ad409dedd347c1843b69a529References: Immunological importance of the second gut segment of carp.
