name: In Vivo and In Vitro Debromination of Decabromodiphenyl Ether (BDE 209) by Juvenile Rainbow Trout and Common Carpurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM16913120public_in: 万方authors: Heather M Stapleton,Brian Brazil,R David Holbrook,abstract: Decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE 209), the major congener in the high volume industrial flame retardant mixture &quot;DecaBDE&quot;, has recently been shown to be metabolized by carp. To further explore this phenomenon, juvenile rainbow trout were exposed to BDE 209 via the diet for a five month period. Analysis of the whole body homogenate, liver, serum, and intestinal tissues revealed that BDE 209 accumulated in rainbow trout tissues and was most concentrated in the liver. In addition to BDE 209, several hepta-, octa-, and nonaBDE congeners also accumulated in rainbow trout tissues over the same period as a result of BDE 209 debromination. Based on the total body burden of the hepta- through decaBDE congeners, uptake of BDE 209 was estimated at 3.2%. Congener profiles were different among whole body homogenate, liver, and serum, with the whole body homogenates having a greater contribution of the debrominated biotransformation products. Extracts of the rainbow trout whole body homogenates were compared with extracts from a previous experiment with common carp. This comparison revealed that BDE 202 (2,2&#039;,3,3&#039;,5,5&#039;,6,6&#039;-octabromodiphenyl ether) was a dominant debromination product in both studies. To determine whether the observed debromination was metabolically driven, liver microsomal fractions were prepared from both common carp and rainbow trout. Analysis of the microsomal fractions following incubation with BDE 209 revealed that rainbow trout biotransformed as much as 22% of the BDE 209 mass, primarily to octa- and nonaBDE congeners. In contrast, carp liver microsomes biotransformed up to 65% of the BDE 209 mass, primarily down to hexaBDE congeners. These microsomal incubations confirm a metabolic pathway for BDE 209 debromination.citations_number: 343Citation: Current-use flame retardants in the eggs of herring gulls (Larus argentatus) from the Laurentian Great Lakes. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=21baf2e8073cc8e801b436d38f248d46Recent developments in the analysis of brominated flame retardants and brominated natural compounds http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cb6aac1348d3a76c6db472b6ccfb2f4aDebromination of decabrominated diphenyl ether by resin-bound iron nanoparticles http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ba6d1194f0c42119c348bf4cc8bdec0fMeasurement of polybrominated diphenyl ethers and metabolites in mouse plasma after exposure to a commercial pentabromodiphenyl ether mixture http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=21ec7dd8cc78468a46bfa95fdea29e4fDevelopmental exposure to decabromodiphenyl ether (PBDE 209): effects on thyroid hormone and hepatic enzyme activity in male mouse offspring. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3ca6d1f6df2c590480702c3cc3cd9802Evidence of debromination of decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) in biota from a wastewater receiving stream. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8f6626fa1b690cc54e7e01c169baa11bAssessment of human exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers in China via fish consumption and inhalation. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f15727f7d09e8437945827da81bcca0ePhotodegradation of decabromodiphenyl ether in house dust by natural sunlight. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d278d6d2641de1aa2216d1e8b84b952fDramatic changes in the temporal trends of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in herring gull eggs from the Laurentian Great Lakes: 1982-2006. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4f10f020c0048f423b67fa3a6d928159Riverine Inputs of Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers from the Pearl River Delta (China) to the Coastal Ocean http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dcb3c5eee095358192cc6b96b0efa7feReferences: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers in the environment and in people: a meta-analysis of concentrations. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3ca5310027e976a0abec3869c69f2bf0Is House Dust the Missing Exposure Pathway for PBDEs?
