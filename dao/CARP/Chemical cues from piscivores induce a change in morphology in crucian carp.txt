name: Chemical cues from piscivores induce a change in morphology in crucian carp [Carassius carassius, Esox lucius, morphological defence, induced defence]url: http://plankt.oxfordjournals.org/external-ref?access_num=10.2307/3545777&amp;link_type=DOIpublic_in: Oxford Univ Pressauthors: Broenmark, C,abstract: Crucian carp (Carassius carassius) develop a deeper body in the presence of northern pike (Esox lucius) and this has been suggested to be a predator-induced morphological defense. The evolution of inducible defenses requires that prey have reliable cues of detecting the predator. Here we investigate the nature of the cues used by crucian carp in a series of laboratory experiments. We monitored the change in body depth of crucian carp when exposed to visual and chemical cues from predators and to alarm substances from conspecifics. Results show that chemical cues are sufficient to induce an increase in body depth of crucian carp. Alarm substances released by injured crucians had no effect on body depth, whereas pike, even when not feeding in the experimental aquaria, induced an increase in body depth. This suggests that chemical cues released by the predator induce the change in crucian body morphology. Chemical cues from perch with a macroinvertebrate diet did not elicit a response, but when perch were fed crucian carp the body depth of crucians increased, i.e. the chemical cue is related to the piscivorous diet of the predator. Removal of predator cues from the aquaria resulted in a limited decrease of body depth. Crucian carp responds to chemical cues from predators with a piscivorous diet, rather than to the predator per se, by increasing body depth. This should be adaptive in habitats with a suite of predators or when predators undergo ontogenetic niche shifts.citations_number: 159Citation: The scent of death: Chemosensory assessment of
