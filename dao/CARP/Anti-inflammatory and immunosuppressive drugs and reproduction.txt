name: Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs and reproductionurl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/ar1957public_in: Springerauthors: Monika Ã˜stensen,Munther Khamashta,Michael Lockshin,abstract: Rheumatic diseases in women of childbearing years may necessitate drug treatment during a pregnancy, to control maternal disease activity and to ensure a successful pregnancy outcome. This survey is based on a consensus workshop of international experts discussing effects of anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive and biological drugs during pregnancy and lactation. In addition, effects of these drugs on male and female fertility and possible long-term effects on infants exposed to drugs antenatally are discussed where data were available. Recommendations for drug treatment during pregnancy and lactation are given.citations_number: 339Citation: American College of Rheumatology 2008 recommendations for the use of nonbiologic and biologic disease\u2010modifying antirheumatic drugs in rheumatoid arthritis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4793ee16b8c96fc3de1ff0f797fdddbeClinical efficacy and side effects of antimalarials in systemic lupus erythematosus: a systematic review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=03f9094ca74986dc992549a87c4812f9[EULAR recommendations for the management of systemic lupus erythematosus]. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0220c164536981da36c0f7ea853a1380Hydroxychloroquine in lupus pregnancy http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a79f9c5acc659c677f679723832267aeLupus activity in pregnancy. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=492570360aa7aa37ac7e0c95a350eb05Association of family history of autoimmune diseases and autism spectrum disorders http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8d7aff8a09132d4c43ccff8331a27472Pregnancy outcomes after maternal exposure to rituximab. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a1e89476a397973195b31f9839e2cdf3The Hopkins Lupus Pregnancy Center: ten key issues in management. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5ebe27bcfc9cd39f48fcf468ded57593Update on safety during pregnancy of biological agents and some immunosuppressive anti-rheumatic drugs. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=47545fc82750e032704d232b3ebc1027Changes in prefrontal axons may disrupt the network in autism http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c9bf8624ca894aebaf0e85a9f4862e83References: Glucocorticoid exposure in utero: new model for adult hypertension. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3257e43284caccff364b516829e8a44bThe transfer of drugs and other chemicals into human breast milk. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=237d0657fd4a9e919af63ae316bbfb24Stroke prevention with the oral direct thrombin inhibitor ximelagatran compared with warfarin in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (SPORTIF II... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5439a28da473ff09eee94270b367009dGlucocorticoid therapy for immune-mediated diseases: basic and clinical correlates http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=77db9a7d3da2521f73d64be91b0c19f1Dysfunction of placental glucocorticoid barrier: link between fetal environment and adult hypertension? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=306bfef920404c3033dce36fcea72349Subcutaneous Fondaparinux versus Intravenous Unfractionated Heparin in the Initial Treatment of Pulmonary Embolism &mdash; NEJM http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1a5881a0554830a6159d02ea959d4692Dysfunction of the placental glucocorticoid barrier: Link between fetal environmental and hypertension? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a3eca0e9d90d68537cbf10e27b2cab12Folic acid antagonists during pregnancy and the risk of birth defects http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7668d7c161bab8584605b612c378483aRisk for sustained amenorrhea in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus receiving intermittent pulse cyclophosphamide therapy http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4895ecef0f39b728aca0e3261f80a6f1Prenatal exposure to prednisone in humans and animals retards intrauterine growth. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ad04f499aad19e73e7533a952445fc5fBirth defects after maternal exposure to corticosteroids: prospective cohort study and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ed19cde4203d4189d785cc27584c0572Exposure to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs during pregnancy and risk of miscarriage: population based cohort study. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=00feca26867fce9de2a83ca3deafb78aBirth defects and drugs in pregnancy. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=92e9df64cf505ee2f189340632e81a8eTeratogenicity: An Epidemiological Study.
