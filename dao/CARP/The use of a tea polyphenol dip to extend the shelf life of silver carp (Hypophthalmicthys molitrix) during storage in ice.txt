name: The use of a tea polyphenol dip to extend the shelf life of silver carp (Hypophthalmicthys molitrix) during storage in iceurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814607010977public_in: Elsevierauthors: Fan, Wenjiao,Chi, Yuanlong,Zhang, Shuo,abstract: The effects of a tea polyphenols (TP) dip treatment on quality changes of silver carp ( Hypophthalmicthys molitrix) during iced storage were examined over a period of 35 days. TP (0.2%, w/v) solution was used for the dip treatment. The control and the treated fish samples were analysed periodically for microbiological (total viable count), chemical (pH, TVB-N, TBA, K-value), and sensory characteristics. The results indicated that the effect of the TP dip treatment on the fish samples was to enable the good quality characteristics to be retained for longer and to extend the shelf life during the iced storage.citations_number: 250Citation: Effect of chitosan coatings enriched with cinnamon oil on the quality of refrigerated rainbow trout
