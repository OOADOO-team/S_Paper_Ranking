name: Studies on the digestive enzymes of grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella  (Val.)url: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004484869190005Rpublic_in: Elsevierauthors: K.M. Das,S.D. Tripathi,abstract: The presence of high amylase and protease activity in fish from the culture pond suggests that incorporation of animal protein, e.g. fish meal, is necessary for the preparation of a diet which would suit the enzyme pattern of the grass carp. Similar to previous research on this species, lipase activity was recorded to be the highest in the hepatopancreas.citations_number: 230Citation: Metabolism and Functions of Lipids and Fatty Acids in Teleost Fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d3d049c4c92732390d972ffb4ceefcaeComparative study of digestive enzymes in fish with different nutritional habits.
