name: Increased leukotriene B4 and interleukin-6 in exhaled breath condensate in cystic fibrosis.url: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM12684249public_in: 万方authors: Giovanna E, Carpagnano,Peter J, Barnes,Duncan M, Geddes,abstract: Chronic neutrophilic airway inflammation is an important feature of (CF). Noninvasive inflammatory markers may be useful in monitoring CF. () and interleukin (IL)-6 are inflammatory mediators that are increased in chronic neutrophilic inflammation. The aim of this study was to assess whether and were increased in exhaled breath condensate of CF patients and whether they could be used to monitor inflammation. Twenty patients with CF (13 males, age of 28 +/- 9 years) were recruited together with 15 age-matched healthy subjects (8 males, age 35 +/- 7 years). and levels were markedly elevated in patients with acute exacerbations (28.8 +/- 4.3 and 8.7 +/- 0.4 pg/ml) compared with control subjects (6.8 +/- 0.7 and 2.6 +/- 0.1 pg/ml, p &lt; 0.0001). We also observed a decrease of exhaled and concentrations after antibiotic treatment in six patients who were followed until clinically stable (31.1 +/- 4.4 and 9.5 +/- 0.4 pg/ml vs. 18.8 +/- 0.8 and 6.4 +/- 0.2 pg/ml, respectively) and an increase in 15 CF patients infected with (34.3 +/- 5.0 and 9.3 +/- 0.3 pg/m) compared with those infected with other (18.3 +/- 0.7 and 6.9 +/- 0.5 pg/ml). These findings suggest that and levels are increased in exhaled breath condensate of patients with CF during exacerbation and could be used to monitor airway inflammation in these patients.citations_number: 180Citation: Exhaled breath condensate: methodological recommendations and unresolved questions. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=83cb6cc354319eb925747f50c511986dLower airway inflammation in infants with cystic fibrosis detected by newborn screening. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0044434d4e7d015e378e213d56761c4cPhylogeny of Choanozoa, Apusozoa, and Other Protozoa and Early Eukaryote Megaevolution http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a71fbe4249f41ac6fad72f954969d9b0IL-23 mediates inflammatory responses to mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection in mice http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f630a599b63c6cb0029cbb401f7bd86bIncreased Leukotriene B4 and Interleukin-6 in Exhaled Breath Condensate in Cystic Fibrosis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f54fa1feac2b679eb1507a0240f9e126Airway Inflammation in Cystic Fibrosis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6bc572ba637937d4136a206d8d73d074The inflammatory role of platelets in cystic fibrosis. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f2b4065a44506a09438e93c18842e52eRelationship between exhaled NO, respiratory symptoms, lung function, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and blood eosinophilia in school children. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cb351386c96bc6b0238ed2f4342d0a40Detection of p53 gene mutations in exhaled breath condensate of non-small cell lung cancer patients http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=32548dd0b72b2c640cc24d91272a3ed5Inflammatory mediators in exhaled breath condensate of children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b68ddc10caf2f7606b4853725ed81b93References: Rapid method for measurement of bronchial responsiveness. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8daee5e20408988650c65976c2c287eaSeverity scoring of atopic dermatitis: the SCORAD index.
