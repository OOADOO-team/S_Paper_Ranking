name: Measuring Political Knowledge: Putting First Things Firsturl: http://www.jstor.org/stable/2111549public_in: JSTORauthors: Michael X Delli Carpini,Scott Keeter,abstract: Research in political behavior has increasingly turned to the cognitions underlying attitudes. The simplest of these cognitions are political facts--the bits of information about politics that citizens hold. While other key concepts in political science--partisanship, trust, tolerance--have widely used (if still controversial) measures that facilitate comparisons across time and among studies, the discipline has no generally accepted measure of the public&#039;s level of political information. This paper describes the development and testing of survey-based measures of political knowledge, with special attention to the existing items on the National Election Study surveys. In so doing, it illustrates the use of a variety of techniques for item analysis and scale construction. We also present a recommended five-item knowledge index.citations_number: 258Citation: Uninformed Votes: Information Effects in Presidential Elections http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=efaf410cb6e6eac0209788cc423edb1dKnowing and Caring about Politics: Gender and Political Engagement http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1323d39d68d87da75303d2f479de62b8ltm: An R Package for Latent Variable Modeling and Item Response Analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=265b74e72717971c8be83f21a3e780b1Patterns of Internet and Traditional News Media Use in a Networked Community http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=26d618c744ce3a875eef6dd8121ba154Campaign Issue Knowledge and Salience: Comparing Reception from TV Commercials, TV News and Newspapers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=400bb1d17087fe934518ba584b1799a7Mass Public Decisions to Go to War: A Cognitive-Interactionist Framework http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d4d02bee06fcc31fbcadad13e996e081Election Night\u2019s Alright for Fighting: The Role of Emotions in Political Participation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8f95071951212f1bdedfcdbcdbacac2cReconsidering the Measurement of Political Knowledge http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a4f0db9ab4892b4476e2870597af1797Asked and Answered: Knowledge Levels When We Will Not Take \u201cDon't Know\u201d for an Answer http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7295049600c3db646ed1867d43991033The Impact of Service Learning on Democratic and Civic Values. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c17d133f46366cbf75f0f69a3be9bdc0References: The nature and origins of mass opinion. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=902acb09f3b8e5fdd439654e41884974Latent Structure Analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ce79f5df1f197c532e7a036718c1ea5cSummated rating scale construction: An introduction. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f1272f193fdac43c079a9b3860bd9094Measuring Political Sophistication http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b0fbdfe5dd1d81e3719707ebd590864eAn Impression-Driven Model of Candidate Evaluation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=95b3db6e3699654b62951fa634b3438fMeasurement in the Social Sciences: The Link between Theory and Data by Richard A.
