name: Calcium channels from Cyprinus carpio skeletal muscle.url: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM1846962public_in: 万方authors: Grabner, M., Friedrich, K., Knaus, H. G.,abstract: The complete amino acid sequence of the L-type calcium channel α1subunit from the carp (Cyprinus carpio) white skeletal muscle was deduced by cDNA cloning and sequence analysis. The open reading frame encodes 1852 amino acids (Mr210,060). A 155-amino acid COOH-terminal sequence (after the fourth internal repeat) is evolutionarily preserved (90% homology) and may represent an important functional domain of L-type calcium channels. The photolabeled, membrane-bound, and purified carp α1subunits have masses of 211 and 190 kDa. The purified channel could not be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Two glycoproteins (α2subunits) are associated with the α1subunit and change their apparent masses from 235 and 220 kDa to 159 kDa upon reduction of disulfide bonds. Nucleic acid hybridization with α2cDNA revealed an 8.0-kilobase transcript in carp skeletal muscle. Evidence for a copurification of subunits similar in size to mammalian β or γ subunits was not obtained.citations_number: 177Citation: HIDDEN MARKOV MODELS IN COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY: APPLICATIONS TO
