name: Influences of traditional Chinese medicine on non-specific immunity of Jian Carp (Cyprinus carpio var. Jian)url: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail?id=PeriodicalPaper_JJ029991818public_in: 万方authors: Jian J,Wu Z,abstract: The influence of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulation from Astragalus Root ( Radix astragalin seu Hedysari) and Chinese Angelica Root ( R. Angelicae Sinensis) at a ratio of 5:1 (w/w) on non-specific immunity of Jian carp, Cyprinus carpio var . Jian was investigated. The number of NBT-positive cells in the blood and lysozyme and complement activities in the serum of Carp fed with commercial feed supplemented with 1.0% (diet 1) and 1.5% (diet 2) TCM at 10 day of post-feeding were not different from those of the control group fed with feed unsupplemented TCM 10 days post-feeding ( P&gt;0.05), but at 20 and 30 days they increased significantly ( P&lt;0.05). The values of diet 1 group and diet 2 group at 20 day and at 30 day were not significantly different ( P&gt;0.05) from each other. In addition, the TCM formula increased body weight of experimental fish by about 16.84% (diet 1) and 19% (diet 2) above that of the control group. Therefore, these data suggest that the TCM formula could elevate the function of non-specific immunity of Jian carp. The optimal dosage added to commercial carp feed was 1.0% (w/w) and the oral administration time as a course of treatment was 20 days.citations_number: 182Citation: Innate immunity of fish (overview). http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c3a47d9f2bded858e78c6809fbd77482Effect of two Chinese herbs ( Astragalus radix and Scutellaria radix ) on non-specific immune response of tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d8904ded63222be6204cf371cf628881Chinese herbs (Astragalus radix and Ganoderma lucidum) enhance immune response of carp, Cyprinus carpio, and protection against Aeromonas hydrophila. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0aef70e4734d5dc3b4214a73ca6555e8Chinese herbs ( Astragalus membranaceus and Lonicera japonica ) and boron enhance the non-specific immune response of Nile tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus ... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=08ce3a665617fb70125393a80a30ec42Impact of plant products on innate and adaptive immune system of cultured finfish and shellfish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3f8e3518867b0d47817ea95204f25214Oral administration of Eclipta alba leaf aqueous extract enhances the non-specific immune responses and disease resistance of Oreochromis mossambicus http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e8aff375a20f615dd76e97bc96a26bd4Effects of anthraquinone extract from rhubarb Rheum officinale Bail on the crowding stress response and growth of common carp Cyprinus carpio var.
