T., Goldspink, G. ,abstract: Abstract These experiments were performed to determine how ectothermal animals maintain their locomotory ability during acute changes in muscle temperature, despite the large thermal dependence of the mechanical properties of their muscle. The electrical activity of the red (slow-twitch) and white (fast-twitch) muscle fibers of carp was monitored while the carp swam at various speeds at 10 and 20 degrees C. The patterns of recruitment of different fiber types were similar at both temperatures. At low speeds only the red muscle was active, whereas at high speeds the white muscle was active as well. The swimming velocity at which white muscle was initially recruited increased from 26 cm/s at 10 degrees C to 46 cm/s at 20 degrees C. These results suggest that the order of recruitment of motor units was the same at 10 and 20 degrees C but that the recruitment occurred over a narrower range of speeds at the low temperature. Hence, to generate the muscle power required to swim at a certain velocity, fish recruit more muscle fibers, which include faster fiber types when their muscle is cold than when their muscle is warm.citations_number: 174Citation: Limits to exhaustive exercise in fish. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d4a3bcd381b8730f39105d384165657eSwimming kinematics of fast starts are altered by temperature acclimation in the marine fish Myoxocephalus scorpius http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ce32363d0a96be87f6c3c365fc32d281How swimming fish use slow and fast muscle fibers: implications for models of vertebrate muscle recruitment http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ce792c2b91bb421468b601f395e698faEnvironment and plasticity of myogenesis in teleost fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8b19e078a277ee6d037e3b46e9a4ec63Excess post-exercise oxygen consumption in adult sockeye(Oncorhynchus nerka) and coho (O. kisutch) salmon followingcritical speed swimming http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7228f3c37f75a269870a9f604cda0698Red and white muscle activity and kinematics of the escape response of the bluegill sunfish during swimming http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b0610da958e1be40960b2a83ddabda02Plasticity of muscle contractile properties following temperature acclimation in the marine fish Myoxocephalus scorpius http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2b1fc354b0ead92ffff3c9cc142abc0cPhysiological basis of temperature-dependent biogeography: trade-offs in muscle design and performance in polar ectotherms. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cf396d106234f39df398e4c694fca84bThermal plasticity of skeletal muscle phenotype in ectothermic vertebrates and its significance for locomotory behaviour. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4d97a5019527118b6e97576d8a3f479aNeuromuscular control of anguilliform locomotion: patterns of red and white muscle activity during swimming in the american eel anguilla rostrata http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ebbc80e0ba30971b6a357b9a54590e5bReferences: The velocity of unloaded shortening and its relation to sarcomere length and isometric force in vertebrate muscle fibres. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2af95da49df99ac5172a63150825d649Control scheme governing concurrently active human motor units during voluntary contractions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=95be44292aa511a6286788a0542ecac4Oxygen consumption and efficiency of swimming goldfish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e4a57710f2f52e62fbc3b3feaec3cebaThermal dependence of endurance and locomotory energetics in a lizard http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d36901535822387c04048c3b61a2a755The pCa\u2010tension and force\u2010velocity characteristics of skinned fibres isolated from fish fast and slow muscles http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a9149e8aae4d6d29da6eb6492ec00fb1Responses of motoneurons of different sizes to graded stimulation of supraspinal centers of the brain http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f9e48037534c167164e76b03af3054b7Diol Esters from the uropygial glands of mallee fowl and stubble quail http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0343b02cd51e951edfeb823b5d76279fThe Effect of Long-Term Exposure to Different Temperatures on the Mechanical Performance of Frog Muscle http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b109bbbbea9f6a3a24a1556623f005c1Energetics of isometric contractions as a function of muscle temperature http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fd655a7f27a0d9a30c26c6f15bfb3e15Effect of Temperature on Metabolism during Running in the Lizard Uromastix aegyptius http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=15708f6c8227b898a069600ddfa7fdef
