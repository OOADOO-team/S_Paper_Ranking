name: Central gustatory paths in the crucian carp, <em>carassius carassius</em>url: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM7400389public_in: 万方authors: Yasuhiro Morita, Hironobu Ito, Hideo Masai,abstract: Abstract The central fiber connections of the gustatory system (VII, IX, and X nerves) in the crucian carp were examined by the Fink-Heimer method and its modification. The sensory and recurrence roots of the VII enter the brainstem separately and terminate in the ipsilateral half of the facial lobe (L-VII). Afferent fibers of the IX terminate in the glossopharyngeal lobe (L-IX). Most afferent fibers of the X terminate in the sensory layer of the vagal lobe (L-X), in which degenerating terminals occur in some laminae. Some vagal afferents project bilaterally to the commissural nucleus of Cajal. The cutaneous component of the X projects to the nucleus of the spinal trigeminal tract (SpV) and the medial funicular nucleus (nFM). Ascending secondary fibers from the L-VII project bilaterally to the secondary gustatory nucleus (nGS) in the isthmus region. Descending secondary fibers from the L-VII turn caudally in the SpV. These fibers terminate mostly in the nucleus of the SpV and sparsely in the nFM. The L-IX and L-X give rise to the long and short secondary paths. The long path projects as the ascending secondary tract to the ipsilateral nGS. The short path includes secondary fibers projecting to the motor layer of the L-X and the medullary reticular formation. Tertiary gustatory fibers arising in the nGS project ipsilaterally to two diencephalic nuclei: the nucleus glomerulosus and the nucleus diffusus lobi inferioris.citations_number: 222Citation: The parcellation theory and its relation to interspecific variability in brain organization, evolutionary and ontogenetic development, and neuronal plasticity http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=007c9cf1b4518e66cacbcae28072f646The evolution of the dorsal pallium in the telencephalon of amniotes: Cladistic analysis and a new hypothesis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0065e3d5b63d5b1c15acb90ae94af908A quantitative study of the reinnervation of the goldfish optic tectum following optic nerve crush. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1d025b5dce6483ad139ad031b2e0e5d0The evolution of the dorsal thalamus of jawed vertebrates, including mammals: cladistic analysis and a new hypothesis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c6bfb944c05cf727f7b204106a1bfe08Morphological aspects of the teleostean visual system: A review. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d3b04accfbc8e42e95107693e052abb2Distribution and characterization of neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity in the brain and pituitary of the goldfish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a52ea95b82f72c50be89f00c77bd9e1cNeuronal architecture of the nucleus of the solitary tract in the hamster http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dbf4164e158d96f511e36458255a5a0fA comparison of the normal and regenerated retinotectal pathways of goldfish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4bc146032cfa640ed660b842f32f0583Regional Specializations in the Oro-Pharyngeal Wall and Food Processing in the Carp (Cyprinus Carpio L.) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0c814e7ffdf6a3598ec68aa08ae479d7Cytoarchitecture and topographic projections of the gustatory centers in a teleost, Carassius carassius http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=13cf73d37a0ccf8a14ca5375df1c316bReferences: An autoradiographic examination of the central distribution of the trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal, and vagal nerves in the monkey http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d51016774d60ae72def081409218a112A Yolk Sac Technique for the Routine Isolation of Brucella: Injection of Clotted Blood Specimens into Embryonating Eggs with Recovery of All Three Species http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=814dcdc2998fa4e928a6276c1b12beedAscending central gustatory pathways. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5387c3cde7e87be4f8c17b1769d02fabCorticofugal fibers to sensory trigeminal nuclei and nucleus of solitary tract; an experimental study in the cat http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=01623e018185512b5b662b94c68f2ad3A stereotaxic atlas and technique for forebrain nuclei of the goldfish, Carassius auratus http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e2dbfff691c12a7f3c50bf77dc851071Structures and functions of the sense of taste in the catfish (Ictalurus natalis). http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3946ef75e6c2dacce635af089a90a9a9Taste pathways in rat brainstem. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=940e6f72d7097c5359a0a4affa6483e6Gustatory pathways in the bullhead catfish.
