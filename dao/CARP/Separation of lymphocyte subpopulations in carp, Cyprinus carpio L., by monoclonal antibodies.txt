name: Separation of lymphocyte subpopulations in carp, Cyprinus carpio L., by monoclonal antibodiesurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM6336715public_in: 万方authors: SECOMBES,C. J.,abstract: Abstract Lymphoid cell populations in various organs of the carp Cyprinus carpio L. were investigated using a series of mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against carp thymocytes and carp serum Ig. Clones have been designated as Ig+T+, Ig+T- or Ig-T+ on the basis of the reactivity with thymocytes and serum Ig in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening. Their reaction to the lymphoid organs of carp was investigated on cryostat sections and cytocentrifuge slides using immunoperoxidase techniques. IG+T+ clones could be subdivided into those that stained reticular fibres around blood vessels in various organs (R+) and those that did not (R-). The former stained most thymocytes and most peripheral lymphocytes as well as plasma cells whereas the latter did not stain cortical thymocytes and some peripheral lymphocytes. IG+T- clones were negative for thymocytes but positive for plasma cells and a certain population of peripheral lymphocytes. Ig-T+ clones reacted similarly to Ig+T+R- clones. It is concluded that fish lymphoid cell populations can be distinguished based upon differences in cell surface and/or cytoplasmic determinants. The monoclonal antibodies described can be used for further structural analysis of the determinants and for functional separation of T- and B-like cells in the &#039;lower&#039; vertebrates.citations_number: 170Citation: Transplantation and in vivo imaging of multilineage engraftment in zebrafish bloodless mutants. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d67bbcbe6ab8e8769ae73df1395a706dThe gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) of carp (Cyprinus carpio L.): an immunocytochemical analysis. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=86f4d90c997b333a0218cd80818505e8\u9c7c\u7c7b\u514d\u75ab\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6982\u51b5 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0364fe56a3e89ac72134bfad0f65be53Immunocytochemical detection of Ig-positive cells in blood, lymphoid organs and the gut associated lymphoid tissue of the turbot ( Scophthalmus maximus ) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8aa4110ee084fab5c79ade3484597f8aMucosal immunoglobulins and B cells of Teleost fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1db2b88ff0739e8c95c87380b0fc1e17Immune and enzyme histochemical phenotypes of lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells within the spleen and head kidney of Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar L.) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4301301b7f766ab3a861fdf1a8adf61cIdentification and characterization of a new major histocompatibility complex class I gene in carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=471d28b490fa53e3742b6e28333e84acLymphocyte heterogeneity in the trout, Salmo gairdneri, defined with monoclonal antibodies to IgM. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b5cc6fcef9dac895fb76641a1bd3389aImmunization of carp (Cyprinus carpio) with a Vibrio anguillarum bacterin: indications for a common mucosal immune system. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e8912b26defcbca32c24c696a3ab3594Identification of a putative antigen receptor on fish nonspecific cytotoxic cells with monoclonal antibodies http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4da67f0a878d892b18c5fdb3dd0a15b0References: Protein thiolation and reversible protein-protein conjugation.
