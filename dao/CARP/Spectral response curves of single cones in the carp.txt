name: Spectral response curves of single cones in the carpurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042698967900612public_in: Elsevierauthors: T. Tomita, A. Kaneko, M. Murakami,abstract: Single cone spectral response curves were obtained with the aid of specially designed equipment. Statistical analysis of 142 records selected from hundreds, based solely on the greatest signal-to-noise ratio, revealed three groups of cones; the red cones (74 per cent) with the peaking wavelength at 611 [plus or minus] 23 m[mu], green cones (10 per cent) at 529 [plus or minus] 14 m[mu], and blue cones (16 per cent at 462 [plus or minus]15 m[mu]). These peaking wavelengths are in close accord with those of single cone absorption spectra measured by Marks and MacNichol in the goldfish by a microspectrophotometer. Apparently, Young&#039;s trichromatic theory applies at the photoreceptor level in Cyprinidae. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authorscitations_number: 250Citation: The Molecular Basis of Visual Excitation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fdbc715d242b22d1cb4dcddb049dddb4The interplexiform cell system.
