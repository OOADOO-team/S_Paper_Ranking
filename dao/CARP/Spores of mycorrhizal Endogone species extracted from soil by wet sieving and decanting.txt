name: Spores of mycorrhizal Endogone species extracted from soil by wet sieving and decantingurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007153663800790public_in: Elsevierauthors: J.W. Gerdemann, T.H. Nicolson,abstract: Extra-matrical spores of Endogone were found to be common in cultivated soils in Scotland. Six types of spores are described which are believed to represent distinct species. In preliminary inoculation experiments 4 of the 6 formed endotrophic mycorrhiza: three of these formed arbuscules and vesicles, and one formed only arbuscules. In field soil extra-matrical spores are much more abundant than spores formed in sporocarps.citations_number: 2291Citation: SHIFTS IN ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL COMMUNITIES ALONG AN ANTHROPOGENIC NITROGEN DEPOSITION GRADIENT http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=438e2fe4ed7a7dfd9a453aab517335a9Species Richness in a Successional Grassland: Effects of Nitrogen Enrichment and Plant Litter http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bc4f1d8d2d9bfa748eb080da9c6f9214Mycrorhizae indirectly enhance competitive effects of an invasive forb on a native bunchgrass http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=82e32b7c6ba8dc930e06510786180111Nitrogen Enrichment Alters Mycorrhizal Allocation at Five Mesic to Semiarid Grasslands http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5502b0ceaf7568bce028cd74d4bed21dEarly events of vesicular&ndash;arbuscular mycorrhiza formation on Ri T\u2010DNA transformed roots http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=38f59fa5b897853d8d21747aed30f244Fungal Associations of Roots of Dominant and Sub-Dominant Plants in High-Alpine Vegetation Systems with Special Reference to Mycorrhiza http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=25043a4a0e57a5cd06ee557f8c0d39e5INTERACTIONS OF VESICULAR\u2010ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL INFECTIONS AND HEAVY METALS IN PLANTS http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fd4ea8cdd219bf455d28b50c92e55670Allelochemicals Isolated from Tissues of the Invasive Weed Garlic Mustard (Alliaria petiolata) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cc666d87b2018f52f8c36b2126df0eccBiological control of Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) in Guadeloupe by imported Tamarixia radiata (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bc54944df95bfe047e688264eca7791aAn obligately endosymbiotic mycorrhizal fungus itself harbors obligately intracellular bacteria. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=42fd640fddaf4908b32c8e0e08b4258eReferences:
