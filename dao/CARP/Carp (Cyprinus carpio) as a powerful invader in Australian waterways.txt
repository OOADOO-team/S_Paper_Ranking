name: Carp (Cyprinus carpio) as a powerful invader in Australian waterwaysurl: http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20043114993.htmlpublic_in: CAB Directauthors: John D. Koehn,abstract: Summary 1. The invasion of carp ( Cyprinus carpio L.) in Australia illustrates how quickly an introduced fish species can spread and dominate fish communities. This species has become the most abundant large freshwater fish in south-east Australia, now distributed over more than 1 million km 2 . 2. Carp exhibit most of the traits predicted for a successful invasive fish species. In addition, degradation of aquatic environments in south-east Australia has given them a relative advantage over native species. 3. Derivation of relative measures of 13 species-specific attributes allowed a quantitative comparison between carp and abundant native fish species across five major Australian drainage divisions. In four of six geographical regions analysed, carp differed clearly from native species in their behaviour, resource use and population dynamics. 4. Climate matching was used to predict future range expansion of carp in Australia. All Australian surface waters appear to be climatically suitable for carp. 5. This assessment strongly reinforces the need for immediate management of carp in Australia to include targeted control of human-assisted dispersal, such as use of carp as bait by anglers, distribution to new locations by anglers and the use of the &#039;Koi&#039; strain in the aquarium industry. 6. Given their historical spread, dispersal mechanisms and ecological requirements, the expansion of carp across most of the remainder of Australia is to be expected.citations_number: 1012Citation: Freshwater biodiversity: importance, threats, status and conservation challenges. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2c5392e87c62aca3912e9f75a9243ae6Spatial effects of reservoirs on fish assemblages in Great Plains streams in Kansas, USA http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=edba9e85fdfaf4a91bb17bd871546b93Spawning phenology and habitat use in a Great Plains, USA, stream fish assemblage: an occupancy estimation approach http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ce61ec6b1e2576a34c7dfe18a763eaaaThe functional role of producer diversity in ecosystems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fe0d06269e621bc251eb31c8868899aeEarly-warning signals for critical transitions. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c383df51383957a66781c4c5aa6ab846Historical Changes in Nebraska's Lotic Fish Assemblages: Implications of Anthropogenic Alterations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=509038c30fe0710fca7262d0e1199b13Current knowledge on non-native freshwater fish introductions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=aa9b0dc5dafdba29d07769765b1a4c1eEcological impacts of nonnative freshwater fishes. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5f5d17ce714b4be8e934dc41bab97492Contrasting impacts of invasive engineers on freshwater ecosystems: an experiment and meta-analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c22d7fcc515f2e79be3c56a50fd16404Integrative freshwater ecology and biodiversity conservation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ed8f2e265ddf618c93e66dcbfc84af62References: Freshwater biodiversity: importance, threats, status and conservation challenges. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2c5392e87c62aca3912e9f75a9243ae6Biological invasions: Lessons for ecology. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dafd9c226661790029c4a559b9bf1d2eQuantifying the evidence for biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning and services. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=59c24ab9836cdce191a1fae7491421b0Extinction rates of North American freshwater fauna. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d915f4fa96fa548d3dc4bec3b004623dLarge\u2010Scale Management Experiments and Learning by Doing http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fa20a0c4055cdad6f11a6c3d444e1ca0Reproductive Guilds of Fishes: A Proposal and Definition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=39061a36b8857a24f584983d86093efdUsing Historical Data to Assess Changes in Wyoming\u2019s Fish Fauna http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3e1a48ebd28c4414599d3baab9b37ae3Spatial effects of reservoirs on fish assemblages in Great Plains streams in Kansas, USA http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=edba9e85fdfaf4a91bb17bd871546b93Biological invasions of fresh water: Empirical rules and assembly theory http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0928f232aff2b1fac6247d167eba6abbSpecies Diversity and Invasion Resistance in a Marine Ecosystem. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a7b801f255cc5abaad2434f6a9c4f799Terminology of Intervals in Fish Development http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=23ad2ca44e35a002c2df2c12a672c0dcBiological indicators of freshwater pollution and environmental management http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=146d6f9e04dd9c3d9324156d09bed65eRisk assessment in conservation biology http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cd3748ea6b5103fd72d514946fdc5dacImproving the Future for Endangered Species http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=40116f279ca0d9e2abde24974053a938Effects of Alien Species on Freshwater Mollusks in North America http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=26c5774f4525b35e11c22cc97b844329Post\u2010Establishment Spread in Large\u2010Scale Invasions: Dispersal Mechanisms of the Zebra Mussel Dreissena Polymorpha http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=47eb28307a5873e1da80949682e1ef62Predicting the identity and impact of future biological invaders: a pr... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b649b141b547901cc6655ee480b80e6dField guide to the freshwater fishes of Australia. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f81abf63cf4a508a550e3f0c111b7994Mechanisms structuring stream fish assemblages: Are there lessons from introduced species? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b86484ffa7574dbfae4ce81bf6e1342bWhat sources of organic carbon drive food webs in billabongs?
