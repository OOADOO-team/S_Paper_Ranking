name: Degenerative arthritis of the wrist: proximal row carpectomy versus scaphoid excision and four-corner arthrodesis.url: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM11172374public_in: 万方authors: Cohen MS,Kozin SH,abstract: Two cohort populations of 19 patients from separate institutions performing exclusively either a scaphoid excision and 4-corner arthrodesis (lunate, capitate, hamate, and triquetrum) or proximal row carpectomy (PRC) for scapholunate advanced collapse arthritis were compared. There were no preoperative differences with respect to age, gender, dominance, stage of arthritis, or preoperative measures of pain and function. The length of the follow-up period averaged 28 months for the 4-corner arthrodesis group compared with 19 months for the PRC patients. At the follow-up examination wrist motion revealed no significant differences in the flexion-extension arc, averaging 81° in the PRC patients and 80° following 4-corner arthrodesis, which was 62% and 58%, respectively, of the opposite wrist. The 4-corner arthrodesis patients maintained greater radial deviation and total percent radial-ulnar deviation of the wrist. Grip strength averaged 71% for the PRC group compared with 79% for the 4-corner arthrodesis patients. Pain relief was similar using a variety of measures and patient satisfaction was equivalent. Function was similar except that the 4-corner arthrodesis patients scored significantly higher on the mental health component of the short form-36 health status survey. No differences were seen on the physical health component or an outcome scale specifically designed for the wrist. Both PRC and scaphoid excision and 4-corner arthrodesis are motion-preserving options for the treatment of scapholunate advanced collapse arthritis with minimal subjective or objective differences in short-term follow-up evaluations.
