name: Nutrient Spatial Heterogeneity: Effects on Community Structure, Physiognomy, and Diversity of Stream Algaeurl: http://www.jstor.org/stable/1937362public_in: JSTORauthors: Catherine M. Pringle,abstract: Nutrient-diffusing substrata (sand-agar plates) were combined with an in situ, flow-through bioassay system to experimentally separate effects of substratum and water enrichment on algal communities in a phosphorus-poor stream in northern Michigan, USA. Glass slides and both control and fertilized sand-agar substrata (N:P @? 16) were exposed to low ambient nutrient levels in a phosphorus-limited stream (N:P @? 40) and to water amended with nitrogen and phosphorus (N:P @? 16). Quantitative cell counts of periphyton taxa and microscopic examination of intact communities on sand-agar substrata indicated that motile biraphid diatom taxa (e.g., Navicula and Nitzschia spp.) responded to nutrients in both the water and substratum, attaining spatial dominance in the upper canopy. These upperstory taxa comprised &gt; 50% total algal biovolume on sand-agar substrata and appeared to interfere with the response of sessile understory taxa (e.g., Achnanthes minutissima, Cocconeis placentula) to inorganic nutrient amendments to the water. Sessile taxa did respond to inorganic nutrients added to the water when growing on glass slides, where algal communities lacked a dense motile upperstory, indicating that substratum type can influence the nature of periphyton taxon response to nutrients. Periphyton community physiognomy and interactions between taxa are interrelating factors regulating algal response to nutrients from different sources. In addition, the form of phosphorus enrichment (inorganic vs. organic) influenced algal growth, physiognomy, and taxon composition. Algal response to the form of phosphorus was dependent on the source of the nutrient (water vs. substratum) and substratum type. Taxon diversity was greater on all nutrient treatments relative to controls on both substratum types. Diversity and species richness were highest on enriched substrata exposed to low ambient nutrient levels, relative to more homogeneous nutrient regimes where communities on enriched substrata were exposed to water amended with nutrients. Results indicate that nutrient spatial heterogeneity between substratum and water is a mechanism maintaining the species diversity of periphytic algae.citations_number: 522Citation: Biodiversity and Ecosystem Productivity in a Fluctuating Environment: The Insurance Hypothesis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1670f5a4c381c3d3f4d2ce83bf7b7bfeHidden treatments in ecological experiments: re-evaluating the ecosystem function of biodiversity http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2a8c9e99909b377b48a66e5f3c4baad7What Is the Observed Relationship between Species Richness and Productivity? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cc4f90187aa8618a3d4677bf4c66a499Estimating the Number of Classes via Sample Coverage http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=71646af7ef121eb453d799b574cf3de1ESA Online Journals - WHAT IS THE OBSERVED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SPECIES RICHNESS AND PRODUCTIVITY? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bb9a3a3bcad7c6e0c6611be7eb975f7bPOPULATION, COMMUNITY, AND ECOSYSTEM VARIATES AS ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS: PHYTOPLANKTON RESPONSES TO WHOLE-LAKE ENRICHMENT http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0449206762bde0c29c6ccd7f9b38270bSETTING EXPECTATIONS FOR THE ECOLOGICAL CONDITION OF STREAMS: THE CONCEPT OF REFERENCE CONDITION http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7f9e69c977c463b0d7e33c8f0421c570PLANT SPECIES RICHNESS IN RIPARIAN WETLANDS\u2014A TEST OF BIODIVERSITY THEORY http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8957e6060ce09617a5ebe82f0a236344Species Richness of Experimental Productivity Gradients: How Important is Colonization Limitation? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=256cd1314b7077fad35c42a07b45aaaeKnowing when to draw the line: designing more informative ecological experiments http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=66e3782d2d506dc2bb23b76e3bd25393References: Patch Dynamics in Lotic Systems: The Stream as a Mosaic http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ddc4844331e8f13c721401ae2665e47dTemporal Succession in a Desert Stream Ecosystem Following Flash Flooding http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=85c8f9e1a07bf26fdec318e73a59adc5Phosphorus Spiralling in a Woodland Stream: Seasonal Variations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4d7e82e250e66b0adfdaa3394a27c837Extraction of chlorophyll a from freshwater phytoplankton for spectrophotometric analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=598b66522069dc48792c01a29f6b5e10Simulation of solute transport in a mountain pool\u2010and\u2010riffle stream: A transient storage model http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=139c84dd53607a5eae81ccd4c2e4a6e3Concepts and Methods for Assessing Solute Dynamics in Stream Ecosystems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5170005f9e066c8eaeae2926119e8a8eBiological indicators of freshwater pollution and environmental management http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=146d6f9e04dd9c3d9324156d09bed65eBiological indicators of freshwater pollution and environmental management http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=143659621aef467635c9536096f3774dThe Limiting Role of Phosphorus in a Woodland Stream Ecosystem: Effects of P Enrichment on Leaf Decomposition and Primary Producers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=70f9ddf9c87d3948124496aea5db2a93Nitrogen fixation in freshwater, estuarine, and marine ecosystems. 2.
