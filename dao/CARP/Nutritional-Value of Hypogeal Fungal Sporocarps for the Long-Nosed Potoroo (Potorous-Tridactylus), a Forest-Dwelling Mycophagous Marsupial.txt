name: Nutritional-Value of Hypogeal Fungal Sporocarps for the Long-Nosed Potoroo (Potorous-Tridactylus), a Forest-Dwelling Mycophagous Marsupialurl: http://www.bioone.org/servlet/linkout?suffix=i1545-1542-91-1-79-Claridge1&amp;dbid=16&amp;doi=10.1644%2F09-MAMM-A-014R.1&amp;key=10.1071%2FZO9940701public_in: BioOneauthors: AW Claridge,SJ Cork,abstract: Although mycophagy (fungus-feeding) is widespread among small ground-dwelling mammals, there has been little evaluation of the nutritional benefits of this feeding habit. In Australia, some members of the Potoroidae (or rat-kangaroo family) consume large amounts of hypogeal fungi throughout the year. Hypogeal fungi appear to be of marginal nutritional quality for small mammals with simple stomachs but potoroos have an enlarged forestomach in which microbial fermentation takes place, and this may allow more effective utilisation of protected nitrogenous components and structural carbohydrates of fungi. In a feeding experiment, we evaluated the nutritional value of sporocarps of the hypogeal fungi Mesophellia glauca (Mg) and Rhizopogon luteolus (R1), for the long-nosed potoroo (Potorous tridacytlus). Although the concentration of nitrogen was high in both fungi, much of that nitrogen was in non-protein form or associated with cell walls and may be either of low nutritional value or protected from digestive enzymes. The concentration of cell-wall constituents (fibre) was high in both fungi, suggesting low availability of digestible energy. Despite these features, the digestibilities of dry matter (Mg 86%, Rl 80%), ingested nitrogen (Mg 72%, Rl 72%) and energy (kJ kg-1) (Mg 93%, Rl 76%) of both fungi were high. Consequently, P. tridactylus maintained positive nitrogen balance and high intakes of digestible and metabolisable energy. We conclude that the sporocarps of hypogeal fungi represent a nutritionally valuable food for rat-kangaroos and suggest that lack of a foregut-fermentation strategy in other similar-sized ground-dwelling mammals in the forests of south-eastern Australia explains why they use the hypogeal fungal resource to a lesser extent than do rat-kangaroos.citations_number: 672Citation: Interrelationships among northern flying squirrels, truffles, and microhabitat structure in Sierra Nevada old-growth habitat http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a323473801d6d9489d4c7ea0ca4e8db3Use of stable isotopes to determine diets of living and extinct bears. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c75b7ea380cced7b5052eec7917194eeInvertebrates and Boreal Forest Management http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4659c535104ba20c270e98799397c948Landscape structure and local habitat characteristics as correlates of Glaucomys sabrinus and Tamiasciurus hudsonicus occurrence http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d15d39da6526cd7ec89010013e72a977Impact of hurricanes on habitat occupancy and spatial distribution of beach mice. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fa926cec7d8b5f773a9ec3f2613495f2Nutritional-Value of Hypogeal Fungal Sporocarps for the Long-Nosed Potoroo (Potorous-Tridactylus), a Forest-Dwelling Mycophagous Marsupial http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=823c2cb08e663d7c42e711c5e05743b0Short-term use of different residual forest structures by three sciurid species in a clear-cut boreal landscape http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f4c8592c3f47e92df30c1949b5576546Seasonal changes in the diet of the long-nosed bandicoot (Perameles nasuta) assessed by analysis of faecal scats and of stable isotopes in blood http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=307abab50797c0c1bc291dd963e4cdcaMammalian biogeography of the Alexander Archipelago of Alaska: a north temperate nested fauna http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=59515f2abf3c9c922973983293224e0cExperimental trials of the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) traversing managed rainforest landscapes: perceptual range and fine-scale movements http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=beb6972f1ff32eca1716b3e479b2460eReferences: Update: hantavirus pulmonary syndrome--United States, 1999. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b26708c81745ea545028e98b7a418840GLIM for ecologists http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9f4bd5876c0bb9ecc049098f1379bd63Fungal-Small Mammal Interrelationships with Emphasis on Oregon Coniferous Forests http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=abee5c65e4b9b4133ea0ae491bf8fd26Nutritional-Value of Hypogeal Fungal Sporocarps for the Long-Nosed Potoroo (Potorous-Tridactylus), a Forest-Dwelling Mycophagous Marsupial http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=823c2cb08e663d7c42e711c5e05743b0Food-Web structure and the fractionation of Carbon isotopes in the bering sea http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=47b94c58e32db8426375735ac9ec53b8Dynamics of Understory Biomass in Sitka Spruce\u2010Western Hemlock Forests of Southeast Alaska http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=934edba76b3771935414696d52615b12Use of fibrous diets by small herbivores: How far can the rules be 'bent'?
