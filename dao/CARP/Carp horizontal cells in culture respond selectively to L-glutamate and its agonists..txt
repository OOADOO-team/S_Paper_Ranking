name: Carp horizontal cells in culture respond selectively to L-glutamate and its agonists.url: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM6278502public_in: 万方authors: Lasater, E. M., Dowling, J. E.,abstract: Horizontal cells were enzymatically isolated from the carp retina and maintained in culture for 2-7 days. Cultured horizontal cells typically had resting membrane potentials of -50 to -70 mV and input resistances of 100-150 mΩ . The cells were treated with a number of neurotransmitter agents and their analogues. Significant responses were evoked only by 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopamine), L-glutamate, and certain glutamate analogues. The responses to dopamine were inconsistent; most often, the membrane hyperpolarized and input resistances increased. However, highly characteristic responses to L-glutamate and its analogues, quisqualate and kainate, were observed in virtually all of the cells tested. The responses consisted of an initial graded depolarization accompanied by a resistance increase, followed in most cases by a prolonged (1-to 2-min) regenerative depolarization. The regenerative component of the response appears to be Ca2+dependent, while the underlying graded potential may be due to a decrease in K+conductance of the membrane.citations_number: 196Citation: Dopamine and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor interactions in the neostriatum. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9dd08681d6fa634594c12fc5993233a0Dopamine enhances excitatory amino acid-gated conductances in cultured retinal horizontal cells http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=50f9b5985d7428a36e509b6f56e42d47Dopamine decreases conductance of the electrical junctions between cultured retinal horizontal cells. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=15c0ca8dfc78fc2c3f00c562568e2f3bModulation of an electrical synapse between solitary pairs of catfish horizontal cells by dopamine and second messengers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=73bddf6af27c53415006f3abc89cad2aPhotoreceptor signals and vision.
