name: Origin and domestication of the wild carp, Cyprinus carpio: from Roman gourmets to the swimming flowersurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004484869400227Fpublic_in: Elsevierauthors: Balon, Eugene K,abstract: This paper uses paleogeographical, morphological, ecological, physiological, linguistic, archeological and historical evidence to explain the origin and history of the domestication of the wild carp. The wild ancestor of the common carp originated in the Black, Caspian and Aral sea drainages and dispersed east into Siberia and China, and west as far as the River Danube. It is represented today by the uncertain east Asian subspecies and by the East European . There is evidence that the Romans were the first to culture carp collected from the Danube, and that the tradition of the &quot;piscinae&quot; was continued in monasteries throughout the Middle Ages. Distribution of the carp west of the Danube&#039;s piedmont zone was clearly caused by humans, as was its introduction throughout the continents. Some domestication in China may have been independent of similar activities in Europe, but most of the modern-day activities with the common carp in Far East Asia are restricted to the domesticated carp imported from Europe, or to hybrids of local and imported strains. The xanthic (red) common carp seem to have first appeared in early cultures of Europe, China and Japan, but reached their fame through recent artificial selection of multicoloured aberrants in the Niigata Prefecture of Japan. The production of the coloured carp-the Japanese &quot;nishikigoi&quot;-at present exceeds in monetary value the production of carp as human food. The nishikigoi as &quot;swimming flowers&quot; delight modern people as much as the taste of carp delighted the Romans at the beginning of carp domestication.citations_number: 283Citation: Accelerating invasion rate in a highly invaded estuary http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a64eeaf2f4c462173a8538c08211eeecAssessing the global threat of invasive species to marine biodiversity http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b8eb30cbc6f4f1ceea679bad35ff3c1How Much Information on Population Biology Is Needed to Manage Introduced Species? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1b270b78c131174ab23a5e07ffd8ef89INVASIVE CORDGRASS MODIFIES WETLAND TROPHIC FUNCTION http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=359caddae27292c262341fced9212f73Behavioral development in animals undergoing domestication http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0f030615ead323f4f8ac33c63341edf0Life-History Strategies Predict Fish Invasions and Extirpations in the Colorado River Basin http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=84fff57f42ab149c90a392cfea99f7eePOSITIVE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN NONINDIGENOUS SPECIES FACILITATE TRANSPORT BY HUMAN VECTORS http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=06afb5fe310b71b9443cc0530e37749fTo be, or not to be, a non&#x2010;native freshwater fish? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fb365503d042afc231623b0623bac6faTo be, or not to be, a non\u2010native freshwater fish? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7f03de6fba0720405880968e1831e41eGlobal diversity of fish (Pisces) in freshwater http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5f7c6319d40a6537610702cfdcedd372References: Reproductive Guilds of Fishes: A Proposal and Definition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=39061a36b8857a24f584983d86093efdTerminology of Intervals in Fish Development http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=23ad2ca44e35a002c2df2c12a672c0dcAdditions and amendments to the classification of reproductive styles in fishes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7e897dc0f21bdc076b3d47ac2add2ed4The Early Evolution of the Domestic Dog http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ec7cbeabd44a220a858d71add4c5bbefDehydration and heat: effects on temperature regulation of East African ungulates. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cfdb6c5a924a6921a1f21eebce07075aAbout processes which cause the evolution of guilds and species http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=13668fcafea26d2a66ce6baed161fc65Early ontogeny of Adinia xenica (Pisces, Cyprinodontiformes): 2.
