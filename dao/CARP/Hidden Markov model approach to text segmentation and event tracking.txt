Yamron,I. Carp,L. Gillick,abstract: Continuing progress in the automatic transcription of broadcast speech via speech recognition has raised the possibility of applying information retrieval techniques to the resulting (errorful) text. For these techniques to be easily applicable, it is highly desirable that the transcripts be segmented into stories. This paper introduces a general methodology based on HMMs and on classical language modeling techniques for automatically inferring story boundaries and for retrieving stories relating to a specific event. In this preliminary work, we report some highly promising results on accurate text. Future work will apply these techniques to errorful transcriptscitations_number: 199Citation: Maximum Entropy Markov Models for Information Extraction and Segmentation. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e766a72327f78ab85d0cb4beeb3e341fMaximum Entropy Markov Models for Information Extraction and Segmentation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=45e9fdfe3ffb96341ea79465ae9470e3Statistical Models for Text Segmentation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9ddf9fd16cebf593983b14b763ded687Automating the Construction of Internet Portals with Machine Learning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=59e4b9b0a7eca57b50c4758fa0508fbbProsody-based automatic segmentation of speech into sentences and topics http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e122d80dc1c4e6db10ea2ca2a441b1b7A Statistical Model for Domain-Independent Text Segmentation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=afffe52045a3e7c6877dce86ddd180f4A Machine Learning Approach to Building Domain-Specific Search Engines http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8c3d81c4de766b1ed9beecc08f2c4b2aSpoken document understanding and organization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6c28e05f8b3ddb58efa51bed75a29924Topic analysis using a finite mixture model \u2606 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c6e9ced7173bb7f16200eae6e7231de7Indexing and retrieval of broadcast news http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0c32fa8b4b2c52c27fc1136a8354a6f3References: Multi-paragraph segmentation of expository text http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=477838ac7fb6067687a16cf9c7d7829dText segmentation by topic http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8a91511ed21df72c02e47d305db30075Text segmentation by topic http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d9aee07e320080c12b9096aa0a2d96dfText segmentation based on similarity between words http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=eb7fb2a9bf7ccc394e9e6339b7fa6d5cText segmentation by topic http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5429a7526f04eecb3b7bd1979c61f05dText Segmentation Using Exponential Models http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b8530f8b03548f2a5fc12134d0b3c5d4Combining Multiple Knowledge Sources for Discourse Segmentation. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2ec6166147aab8d199f7e8b1c3966022Text Segmentation Using Exponential Models http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cb02e1cb630d73b82efa8a5a08b066dcText segmentation based on similarity between words http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ed21200d983bf2abed4bc83f241316e9
