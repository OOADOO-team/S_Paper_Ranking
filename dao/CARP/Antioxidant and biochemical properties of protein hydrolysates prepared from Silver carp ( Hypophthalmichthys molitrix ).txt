name: Antioxidant and biochemical properties of protein hydrolysates prepared from Silver carp ( Hypophthalmichthys molitrix )url: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814607010084public_in: Elsevierauthors: Shiyuan Dong,Mingyong Zeng,Dongfeng Wang,abstract: The antioxidant and biochemical properties of enzymatically hydrolyzed silver carp ( Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) protein were studied. The molecular weight of the main peaks of the hydrolysates by both Alcalase and Flavourzyme was lower than 5000 Da. The hydrolysates treated by Alcalase for ⩾1.5 h (hydrolysis time) showed that the relative proportion of &lt;1000 Da fraction was more than 60%. For the biochemical properties, hydrolysis by both enzymes increased protein solubility to above 75% over a wide pH range; and when the hydrolysis time was prolonged (&gt;3 h), the colour of the hydrolysates turned yellowish. The protein hydrolysates exhibited significant hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity and inhibited linoleic acid peroxidation. For Alcalase treatment, the hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity and the inhibition of linoleic acid peroxidation of hydrolysates appeared to reach a maximum level for 1.5, 2.0 h of hydrolysis, respectively; and their antioxidant activity was close to that of α-tocopherol in a linoleic acid emulsion system, and carnosine in the 2-deoxyribose oxidation system. The hydrolysate with lower molecular weight distribution possessed stronger Fe 2+ chelation ability at a sample concentration of 5.0 mg/mL. The results suggested that the antioxidant activity of silver carp protein hydrolysates were related to its degree of hydrolysis (DH), hydrolysis time and molecular weight.citations_number: 296Citation: Amino acid composition and antioxidant properties of pea seed ( Pisum sativum L.) enzymatic protein hydrolysate fractions. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=52d75492800f8386db31099dc3816c2aPurification and identification of anti-oxidant soybean peptides by consecutive chromatography and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fa1c3257670c164bb18e2f85d65091bcBioactive peptides from muscle sources: meat and fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b12e848663b49dde56eb49aa8cf705acEffect of degree of hydrolysis on the antioxidant activity of loach (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus) protein hydrolysates. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=309826a95e63f6f16ebaa41ddb4e4600Fish protein hydrolysates: proximate composition, amino acid composition, antioxidant activities and applications: a review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8e6c15152a906a92a48be54d12b27e85Antioxidant and antimicrobial peptidic hydrolysates from muscle protein sources and by-products http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8c8c826ce682aa486333e555132a3282Purification of antioxidative peptides prepared from enzymatic hydrolysates of tuna dark muscle by-product. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c9ed1cd38d29ed26f63b4e6faacbffcdChanges in the antioxidant activity of loach ( Misgurnus anguillicaudatus ) protein hydrolysates during a simulated gastrointestinal digestion http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f8438942a1eacdda6bfdc0ab730c5671Purification and identification of antioxidative peptides from loach (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus) protein hydrolysate by consecutive chromatography and ele... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bac4cbaacbad1c7b3850504f5b5ba23fThree novel angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides from cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) using digestive proteases http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=024a0fc9b7111ad70b893e954abd9d7bReferences: Enzymic hydrolysis of food proteins \/ Jens Adler-Nissen http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=80cef969261f153d8d1847846e9fa8a8Free amino acids and peptides as related to antioxidant properties in protein hydrolysates of mackerel ( Scomber austriasicus ) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3443f6d01a71ecdeea2ad5d6d69c0294Structural Analysis of Antioxidative Peptides from Soybean .beta.-Conglycinin http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=21b8ed03a13a19fa421b4dcc02726f0cRole of ferritin as a lipid oxidation catalyst in muscle food. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=62c1023e3407de58db378f9c3878fa0cAntioxidant Activity of Designed Peptides Based on the Antioxidative Peptide Isolated from Digests of a Soybean Protein http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ecd829e5fcbcc32303f4604a8f6bdfbfAntioxidant Activity of Peptides Obtained from Porcine Myofibrillar Proteins by Protease Treatment http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=23bcacdd9e37c8c9bace21d5d57f30fcAntioxidative activity and functional properties of protein hydrolysate of yellow stripe trevally (Selaroides leptolepis) as influenced by the degree of hy... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e285bd1d4aa61bb63eb50626cc269563Production and characteristics of protein hydrolysates from capelin (Mallotus villosus). http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a2566ae4af4939b133c52cb3f216c9e4Purification and characterization of antioxidative peptides from protein hydrolysate of lecithin-free egg yolk http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=05eddb895a4c840ba27e0ae975362ffdProtein hydrolysates for Pacific whiting solid wastes. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8b05b8661b44d9010df7348f9fe15a16Investigation of jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas) skin gelatin peptides for their in vitro antioxidant effects http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=980a5174e8054cd69beff487447c0967Preparation of antioxidant enzymatic hydrolysates from alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin.
