name: Estimation of Fish Biomass Using Environmental DNAurl: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3338542/public_in: NCBIauthors: Teruhiko Takahara,Toshifumi Minamoto,Hiroki Yamanaka,abstract: Environmental DNA (eDNA) from aquatic vertebrates has recently been used to estimate the presence of a species. We hypothesized that fish release DNA into the water at a rate commensurate with their biomass. Thus, the concentration of eDNA of a target species may be used to estimate the species biomass. We developed an eDNA method to estimate the biomass of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) using laboratory and field experiments. In the aquarium, the concentration of eDNA changed initially, but reached an equilibrium after 6 days. Temperature had no effect on eDNA concentrations in aquaria. The concentration of eDNA was positively correlated with carp biomass in both aquaria and experimental ponds. We used this method to estimate the biomass and distribution of carp in a natural freshwater lagoon. We demonstrated that the distribution of carp eDNA concentration was explained by water temperature. Our results suggest that biomass data estimated from eDNA concentration reflects the potential distribution of common carp in the natural environment. Measuring eDNA concentration offers a non-invasive, simple, and rapid method for estimating biomass. This method could inform management plans for the conservation of ecosystems.citations_number: 160Citation: Monitoring endangered freshwater biodiversity using environmental DNA. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d3a69c4ad85b1ba3df56f8e0a02659c3Detection of a Diverse Marine Fish Fauna Using Environmental DNA from Seawater Samples http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d07ed6b2dea6b01395d837c423558eb8Sequencing our way towards understanding global eukaryotic biodiversity http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=00a3da8c08b01a25c2c64b010c64110dEnvironmental DNA for wildlife biology and biodiversity monitoring. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bfbbabb1da24a5fdf899b6e0781fb0baEstimation of Fish Biomass Using Environmental DNA http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=699da4baf191b3edb5ebcad8d5f2f45dRobust detection of rare species using environmental DNA: the importance of primer specificity http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4ebbe1f60017806480f39d9bb871beffEstimating occupancy and abundance of stream amphibians using environmental DNA from filtered water samples http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=efd81c10b96c07b7d8498f3a8769d1c0Conservation in a cup of water: estimating biodiversity and population abundance from environmental DNA http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3822009fe172e552f2ffad5e2a12c554REVIEW: The detection of aquatic animal species using environmental DNA \u2013 a review of eDNA as a survey tool in ecology http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=86c558dfe1d5f613195215cd82c0df71Environmental Conditions Influence eDNA Persistence in Aquatic Systems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4be8a96e2c23f1af33f219ff3e6c09b4References: Predation : direct and indirect impacts on aquatic communities \/ edited by W.
