name: Genetic variability in reared stocks of common carp ( Cyprinus carpio L.) based on allozymes and microsatellitesurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848600005342public_in: Elsevierauthors: Jean Fran√ßois Desvignes,Jean Laroche,Jean Dominique Durand,abstract: The genetic variability of cultured stocks of common carp ( Cyprinus carpio) was studied using two types of genetic markers: allozymes and microsatellites. A comparative analysis was investigated between six strains from extensive aquaculture in two French regions (Dombes and Forez) and five strains from the Czech Republic stemming from artificial selection and maintained in the Research Center of Vodnany. Observed heterozygosity from allozyme data varied from 0.003 to 0.029 for French strains and was significantly lower than that observed for Czech strains, which varied from 0.026 to 0.058. The genetic variability of microsatellites for the whole data set was considerably higher than that for allozymes. The mean number of alleles per microsatellite locus was higher for French strains than for Czech strains (respectively, 6.2 and 4.2). Microsatellites are generally considered to be selectively neutral and the reduction of microsatellite allelic diversity in Czech strains could be related to a possible population bottleneck associated with breeding practice. However, the patterns of genetic variation for the two types of marker are possibly biased by the limited number of sampled individuals and must be confirmed in the future by more extensive studies. Significant differentiation between the strains was shown using F statistics, whatever the tested groupings, and no obvious difference was detected between relationships inferred with the two types of genetic markers. A neighbour-joining analysis of genetic distances (chord distance of Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards [Am. J. Hum. Genet 19 (1967) 233.]) between strains showed that the topologies of the trees for microsatellites and allozymes were globally congruent. However, a more pronounced discrimination between the strains of the two countries was detected by the microsatellite markers which appeared more suitable to infer the effect of the geographical separation of the ancestral strains or different culture histories.citations_number: 130Citation: Microsatellites within genes and ESTs of common carp and their applicability in silver crucian carp http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1f08334d97deabb165f4af9845bbbd1eLoss of genetic variation at microsatellite loci in hatchery strains of the Pacific abalone ( Haliotis discus hannai ) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ca2c8f132be6921984fdc24ea4626cd3Loss of microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA variation in hatchery strains of Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f6ca39370872d6cdcfb3f287c419ee02Invasion without a bottleneck: Microsatellite variation in natural and invasive populations of the brown mussel Perna perna (L). http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5307950a247ccba2c8743c73e5d69a5dGenetic variability assessed by microsatellites in cultured populations of the pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) in China http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7aa47d43033037f8f1387013be830b34Population structure of plaice (Pleuronectes platessa L.) in northern Europe: microsatellites revealed large-scale spatial and temporal homogeneity. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b16fee8c8ee6b58533c35c3859a1af2dGenetic variability and structure of common carp ( Cyprinus carpio) populations throughout the distribution range inferred from allozyme, microsatellite an... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=453d319f0d1ac7d4ea0c6a76141d6260Genetic analysis of two common carp broodstocks by RAPD and microsatellite markers. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0f8bba4a0da973c810cffe951fd7d49f\u6c34\u4ea7\u751f\u7269\u5fae\u536b\u661f\u6807\u8bb0\u6280\u672f\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\u53ca\u5176\u5e94\u7528 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=afc7a1edd33d8ee5db786f569461697eSelective breeding of quantitative traits in the common carp ( Cyprinus carpio): a review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e41960bc7081fe4cd24a4c71cd1b7607References: Microsatellite DNA in fishes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0761b365082f507c810a2815853634ecMicrosatellite markers in common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8943017ae81401dab5654d8b80b3f159Microsatellite genetic variation between and within farmed and wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f7350a944bde09698d3150db31353a86Protein and microsatellite single locus variability in Salmo salar L.
