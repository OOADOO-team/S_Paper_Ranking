name: Microclimate and vegetation edge effects in a fragmented podocarp-broadleaf forest in New Zealandurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006320794900108public_in: Elsevierauthors: Andrew Young,Neil Mitchell,abstract: Abstract Microclimate (photosynthetically active radiation; air temperature; vapour pressure deficit) and vegetation edge effects were investigated in five podocarp-broadleaf forest fragments in the North Island of New Zealand. Distinct forest edge microclimate regimes were found to exist for part of the year and these were associated with differences in vegetation composition and structure between the forest edge and interior. Some species-specific edge/interior differences could be related to timing of critical life history stages (e.g. germination and early establishment) relative to the temporal stability of edge microclimate regimes. Penetration of gross microclimatic edge effects was approximately 50 m regardless of fragment size. These results suggest that regularly shaped forest fragments &lt;9·10 ha are dominated by edge patterns and processes and that below 1·0 ha fragments do not support forest interior conditions or vegetation associations.citations_number: 321Citation: Ecological Responses to Habitat Edges: Mechanisms, Models, and Variability Explained http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=292e0f7af2133151266892caef6788eaThe matrix matters: effective isolation in fragmented landscapes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=24efd50c55a2fcb6f341929c0a60332fLowland forest loss in protected areas of Indonesian Borneo. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=82cd7b88e8068aef6c5ee86161a5672cGrowing\u2010Season Microclimatic Gradients from Clearcut Edges into Old\u2010Growth Douglas\u2010Fir Forests http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b6c08ecf8e991bb9a1f6c83680bf4eb5Ecological Thresholds: The Key to Successful Environmental Management or an Important Concept with No Practical Application? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bf60f88d4775f000ae18aacc33596f3eEdge Influence on Forest Structure and Composition in Fragmented Landscapes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=51fbe8f18ddf30078f4fc2783dec8c75Vegetation and microclimatic edge effects in two mixed-mesophytic forest fragments http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8e972593315e94ef288129445c7c0355POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON ECOSYSTEM AND TREE SPECIES DISTRIBUTION IN BRITISH COLUMBIA http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4a7bae77206078f769e28060cd272f79Ecological consequences of habitat fragmentation: implications for landscape architecture and planning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6a8265c4f45d9bc87d3d8cf2295630c7PLANT DIVERSITY IN MANAGED FORESTS: UNDERSTORY RESPONSES TO THINNING AND FERTILIZATION http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0325b6553a8251e8fc8bc8a00f8edf8aReferences: Smithsonian Meteorological Tables http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d597865f9b61dabe7cf6d4f7af8e74f7Effects of isolation on the water status of forest patches in the Brazilian Amazon. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=21491240644171ababeb767a4ca2c5b7Predicting the impacts of edge effects in fragmented habitats. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a59bbf64ecfc67abce6f1be607e920baVegetation Structure and Environmental Conditions of Forest Edges in Panama http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=26eb474e7ad7c9126de4d73afea4de83Name changes in the indigenous New Zealand flora, 1960\u20131986 and Nomina Nova IV, 1983\u20131986* http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6dee29b9b761112898a9acd25072df5cVarietal grass names and combinations published by Hackel in Cheeseman''s Manual of the New Zealand Flora, 1906 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3372eba76910f9a27d91b72e01983707A Simple Method of Measuring Integrated Light Values in the Field http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6645a76c8ec245834d11f4e5e9c2f52cVegetation Analysis of North and South Edges in a Mature Oak\u2010Hickory Forest http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4bf9140fbb7f9a0272475690aefae478Forestry issues and conservation in Uganda. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a9d7266d0910a1798ba3eca0eeb10a9fForest Destruction in Asia and the South Pacific http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=edd22ddd981f418b46053486b43a26ccA map of the Pre-European vegetation of Lower Northland, New Zealand http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fbcda761b808a21fbb0e82edbbdbbbc3
