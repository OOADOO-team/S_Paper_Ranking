name: PUBLIC DELIBERATION, DISCURSIVE PARTICIPATION, AND CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT: A Review of the Empirical Literatureurl: http://www.emeraldinsight.com/servlet/linkout?suffix=b33&amp;dbid=16&amp;doi=10.1108%2FJRIM-03-2013-0015&amp;key=10.1146%2Fannurev.polisci.7.121003.091630public_in: Emeraldauthors: Carpini, Michael X. Delli, Cook, Fay Lomax, Jacobs, Lawrence R.,abstract: Many theorists have long extolled the virtues of public deliberation as a crucial component of a responsive and responsible democracy. Building on these theories, in recent years practitioners-from government officials to citizen groups, nonprofits, and foundations-have increasingly devoted time and resources to strengthening citizen engagement through deliberative forums. Although empirical research has lagged behind theory and practice, a body of literature has emerged that tests the presumed individual and collective benefits of public discourse on citizen engagement. We begin our review of this research by defining &quot;public deliberation&quot;; we place it in the context of other forms of what we call &quot;discursive participation&quot; while distinguishing it from other ways in which citizens can voice their individual and collective views on public issues. We then discuss the expectations, drawn from deliberative democratic theory, regarding the benefits (and, for some, pitfalls) assumed to derive from public deliberation. The next section reviews empirical research as it relates to these theoretical expectations. We conclude with recommendations on future directions for research in this area.citations_number: 572Citation: Psychological perspectives on legitimacy and legitimation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dd63f6388a98775c72a1ed800a1bae4dDeliberative Democratic Theory and Empirical Political Science http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4c41a508e567601860514212b4c3abd9Election Forecasts With Twitter: How 140 Characters Reflect the Political Landscape http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2e302dad65acedcc6fdbe33965acf4abMedia consumption and public engagement: beyond the presumption of attention http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0bc17b16b554d60269e8edf992e98117Online Groups and Political Discourse: Do Online Discussion Spaces Facilitate Exposure to Political Disagreement? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e914a8213d08a76f848ba381b9785cf6Politically motivated reinforcement seeking: Reframing the selective exposure debate. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9db511489893a676e814e2b04ae7bcf0Democratization as Deliberative Capacity Building http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=00b1efcbe8c261af913934acf60318b6Birds of a Feather Tweet Together: Integrating Network and Content Analyses to Examine Cross\u2010Ideology Exposure on Twitter http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8f0e9ee4085e93291a65a1c3956a4571Birds of a Feather Tweet Together: Integrating Network and Content Analyses to Examine Cross-Ideology Exposure on Twitter http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2fe2b528c4d26ad0b55bc14de4a6f83aHow new media affords network diversity: Direct and mediated access to social capital through participation in local social settings: http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b61c8f067629453c324386f493f740dfReferences: THE SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF PROCEDURAL JUSTICE http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=868aca3bc90c01326aedde0fcc3c00d0The need for cognition. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4e6f37131a70e27ec30ac8d73eac12b2Between Facts and Norms: Contributions to a Discourse Theory of Law and Democracy.
