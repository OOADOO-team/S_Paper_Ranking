name: Quantitative estimation of proteolytic enzyme and ultrastructural study of anterior part of intestine of Indian major carp (Catla catla) larvae during ontogenesis.url: http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20003010120.htmlpublic_in: CAB Directauthors: Sunil Kumar,Sharma, J. G,Chakrabarti, R,abstract: Specific proteolytic enzyme activity and ultrastructure of the anterior part of the intestine of Catla catla larvae were studied during ontogenesis. Specific proteolytic activity of larvae cultured under three feeding schemes of live-food, refrigerated-plankton food and starvation showed that enzyme activity increased with age regardless of feeding conditions.
