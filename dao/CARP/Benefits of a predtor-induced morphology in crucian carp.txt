name: Benefits of a predtor-induced morphology in crucian carpurl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00328363public_in: Springerauthors: P. Anders Nilsson,Christer Br√∂nmark,Lars B. Pettersson,abstract: Crucian carp (Carassius carassius) develop a deeper body in response to chemical cues from piscivores. This change in body morphology has been suggested to be a predator-induced defence. Here we investigate the possible benefits of the induced body morphology in laboratory experiments. Pike foraging behaviour when feeding on crucian carp of different body depths was recorded using video. Further, in a preference experiment pike were allowed to choose between shallow-bodied and deep-bodied crucian carp of similar lengths. Crucian carp body morphology did not affect predatory behaviours (activity, searching, following, observing, capture success) in northern pike, but an increase in crucian carp body depth led to an increase in handling time in pike. In the preference experiment, pike preferred shallow-bodied crucian carp over deep-bodied. Thus, a change in body morphology, induced by the presence of piscivores, benefits crucian carp by increasing piscivore handling times and an avoidance of the deep-bodied phenotype.citations_number: 151Citation: Evaluating Loci for Use in the Genetic Analysis of Population Structure http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0f0b3bba30079f16e83df5db66c9ada0A STANDARDIZED GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION MEASURE http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fab827adf79d0346302784ca64a7dff1Molecular Signatures of Natural Selection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=493a7d3f13f976c52f30dd1577ba4fe9STABILIZING SELECTION AND THE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF ADAPTATION http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9c5b31e8349121057f472bb803ae7eb1Sympatric speciation in palms on an oceanic island. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=22dd20979d61c683f976f66d3ae62de6Permutation tests for multi-factorial analysis of variance http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ca37f1b7a266fc088ccb27eea9264a8eHow much variance can be explained by ecologists and evolutionary biologists? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=baad90913f589991b53e6e669b4fc99bNear-neutrality in evolution of genes and gene regulation. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d382f5e49b763c7ba02c1339c3b25d73Integrating Function and Ecology in Studies of Adaptation: Investigations of Locomotor Capacity as a Model System http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=eeb0cdaa861c331f22f4ee1449b89cf3Hybridization in the recent past. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9c311adc5041424e885fdba404393788References: Geographic variation, speciation, and clines. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e49a3215ef1d0ce8e8161df3faacc444Unrepeatable Repeatabilities: A Common Mistake http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0b0cc236b29b42b17c8977be373b0239Procedures for the Analysis of Comparative Data Using Phylogenetically Independent Contrasts http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e82be9fbcb2dc7d5a3f0025ae6af27deAdaptation and natural selection.
