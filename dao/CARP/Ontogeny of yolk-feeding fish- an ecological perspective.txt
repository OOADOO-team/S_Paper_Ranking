name: Ontogeny of yolk-feeding fish: an ecological perspectiveurl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1022603204337public_in: Springerauthors: Ewa Kamler,abstract: Ontogeny is a continuous process with temporaryaccelerations. The embryonic period from eggactivation to hatching, and the larval periodthereafter, are considered. Advances in studieson the ontogeny of yolk-feeding Europeanfreshwater and Antarctic marine fish arecompared. New techniques and approaches aresummarized. A method for exact quantificationof the time to any developmental event isrecommended. Four attempts to quantify anindividual&#039;s ontogenetic advancement arereviewed, of which Fuiman&#039;s ontogenetic indexseems to be the best choice. The relationshipbetween the time to any ontogenetic event(τ, days) and temperature (t, °C)has been quantified by exponential, power law,Bělehradek&#039;s, Leiner&#039;s, and polynomialmodels, whose common weaknesses are that theparameters have no biological meaning, and theydo not allow comparison of temperaturerequirements between species. The ontogeneticrate (V = 1/τ, days −1 ) was welldescribed (r 2  = 0.92 − 1.00) by a straightline V = a + bt (linear model) in 44 fishspecies over a broad low-mortality temperaturerange. The linear model produces biologicallymeaningful parameters: the temperature ofbiological zero t 0  = −a/b, effectivetemperature t eff  = t −: t 0 , andeffective day-degrees D° eff  = τ(t − t 0 ) = b −1 . From t 0  andD° eff  the time to any ontogeneticevent can be computed as: τ =D° eff /(t − t 0 ). In coldwaterspecies low t 0  is accompanied by highD° eff , whereas in warmwater speciesthe opposite is true. The linear model wasvalidated. Day-degrees (D° = τt)and physiological day-degrees (PD° =τt/q, where q is Winberg&#039;s temperaturemetabolic correction factor) are based onincorrect assumptions. Their use as temperature-independent measures of ontogeneticadvancement is not advised; by contrast,effective day-degrees (D° eff )are temperature-independent and arerecommended. The remaining extrinsic factorsaffecting ontogenetic rate during yolk feedingare: oxygen, salinity, pH, light, dissolvedbiotic compounds, and anthropogenic factors.The main intrinsic factor is egg size, whichpositively affects the time to particularontogenetic steps at inter- and intra-specificlevels. Attempts to quantify the combinedeffects of temperature and salinity, and oftemperature and egg size, are reviewed.citations_number: 192Citation: Ontogeny of osmoregulation in postembryonic fish: a review. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e55a3e89d1a75622049b29f909740541Testing hypotheses of aging in long-lived painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d955f1def9c6d69f4d0a746b978caf35Interactions between behaviour and physical forcing in the control of horizontal transport of decapod crustacean larvae. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1e91bcd01a6031ef3a1483434d17229cBrain Network Connectivity in Individuals with Schizophrenia and Their Siblings http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=56d5bfced80cd48ba6dae85b076c8a15Molecular identification methods of fish species: reassessment and possible applications. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2e245174da3d1ce552b6a9eeb73e1ed4Resource allocation in yolk-feeding fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=71c386ba6ccd9845f285d97bb9606c60Why do Foraging Stream Salmonids Move During Summer? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6352df3f79ff0d03bed015ea3cf6143aLittle left in the tank: metabolic scaling in marine teleosts and its implications for aerobic scope http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ed0121b999d4ede95d04177f762de1e4Evidence for the effect of learning on timing of reproduction in blue tits. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=81a2b7c822e2ceb195920540003cb62eSandeel recruitment in the North Sea: demographic, climatic and trophic effects http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=37e88fd932daa852e4d31aa7d3ccb27eReferences: 10 Environmental Factors and Growth http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=78f74213ab5300be0f1f2aec39f48b81Terminology of Intervals in Fish Development http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=23ad2ca44e35a002c2df2c12a672c0dcEgg quality in fish: what makes a good egg? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1a8fdb053fcc299ad30ec60eeb8333efThe Influence of Egg Size on Herring Larvae (Clupea harengus L.) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9f004f7572e7bff92cccf95e14dea478The Concise Oxford dictionary of current English:based on the Oxford English dictionary and its supplements http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=91ef286150d331d4f7d47513b5c74d99Relation Between Egg Size, Growth, and Natural Mortality of Larval Fis... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cc2bad15cf2663b51016347759ffa6f2Growth, Metabolism, and Optimal Swimming Speed of a Pelagic Fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=11122bc2226369b388f1753c0008bd2c1 Pattern and Variety in Development http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7fe068dc6d8d22f2874ebe526b2e34f8Early Life History of Fish: An Energetics Approach by Ewa Kamler http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8293cdb828f345d27a02af7aab5e9d884 Development: Eggs and Larvae http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d646c48a04c6cbbb334ea033b10acd3aSignificance of Egg and Larval Size to Recruitment Variability of Temp... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f2f91fad2a9170891a7a241b5d39a849Early Life History and Recruitment in Fish Populations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=33c6312f3e880498ee4a9c76e2f48fe0Effect of Female Size, Egg Size, and Water Temperature on Developmental Biology of Chum Salmon ( Oncorhynchus keta ) from the Nitinat River, British Columbia http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7bb2542cf654c91cb16a7a3d2f7c9b6bMeristic and morphometric variation in pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbu... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c9d61df3edec326ab873d3f84e88a119Controlled propagation of the African catfish, Clarias lazera (C. & V.).
