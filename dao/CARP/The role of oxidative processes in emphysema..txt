name: The role of oxidative processes in emphysema.url: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM6600889public_in: 万方authors: Janoff A,Carp H,Laurent P,abstract: Abstract Elastase/elastase inhibitor imbalance in the lung has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary emphysema. In light of this, it may be significant that the activity of two major elastase inhibitors, alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-antitrypsin, alpha 1Pi) and bronchial mucous proteinase inhibitor, can be decreased by oxidizing agents. The effect can be observed with ozone, substances present in cigarette smoke, and oxygen metabolites generated by lung macrophages as well as peroxidative systems released by other phagocytic cells. Thus alpha 1Pi recovered from lung washings of cigarette smokers has only half the predicted normal activity per mg inhibitor and contains 4 moles of methionine sulfoxide (oxidized methionine) per mole of inactive inhibitor. By contrast, alpha 1Pi purified from nonsmokers&#039; lung washings is fully active and contains only native methionine. At the same time, lung washes from some smokers show significantly greater hydrolytic activity against a specific synthetic elastase substrate than do lung washes of nonsmokers. These findings suggest that some smokers may develop an acquired imbalance between elastase and elastase inhibitor in their lungs, favoring activity of the enzyme. In addition to the potential effect of cigarette smoking on lung elastase/elastase inhibitor balance, smoking also may interfere with elastin repair mechanisms. Specifically, acidic water-soluble gas phase components of cigarette smoke prevent synthesis of desmosine cross-links during elastinogenesis in vitro. This report will attempt to correlate the foregoing information on biochemical changes in the lung induced by cigarette smoking with the development of emphysema in the smoker.citations_number: 313Citation: Oxygen-derived free radicals in postischemic tissue injury. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=99a5e28cf9cc69126a812fa8391c9b35The expression and distribution of the hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha in normal human tissues, cancers, and tumor-associated macrophages http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3a3b2c4b4fc21002429f9a4e3659133cHIF-1\u03b1 Is Essential for Myeloid Cell-Mediated Inflammation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c4eb75b7bd6bbc563637689c60bd1b62Schistosomiasis and water resources development: systematic review, meta-analysis, and estimates of people at risk http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a3d2950c0bc00b55e249e1a21c771160Free-radical chemistry of cigarette smoke and its toxicological implications. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=620c73734c534d39665a8179f665bcd9Biochemistry of oxidative stress http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cabfd5b5072b212ffee56c5a1fbf9acfPhagocytes and oxidative stress. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f06f609264892095f21e2f1af2be1d7eOxidative Stress in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=48f351c44a563b08e7c7ed20c1eecbc5Macrophages and polymorphonuclear neutrophils in lung defense and injury http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0ec3f2fa31cf2bc96ad34cce2e98ef3dNitric oxide synthase: aspects concerning structure and catalysis. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8aeabc332e93b96fac2003c2109dfc5dReferences: Folate and aplasia of bone marrow http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=886d492951c5d99daba13c6293923e89Free radicals and inflammation: protection of synovial fluid by superoxide dismutase. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=75b5a58a68666f36e770ea4d8f4b4dccKinetics of association of serine proteinases with native and oxidized alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ba99148613599a8fb455e020dfb2bd4eMapping the extended substrate binding site of cathepsin G and human leukocyte elastase.
