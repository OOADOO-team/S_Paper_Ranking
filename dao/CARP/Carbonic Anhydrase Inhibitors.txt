name: Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitorsurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960894X10006384public_in: Elsevierauthors: P.A. Preisig,R.D. Toto,R.J. Alpern,abstract: The purpose of the present review is to describe the use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in clinical medicine and renal physiology. We first describe the localization of carbonic anhydrase within the kidney and then discuss evidence for its role in renal acidification and NaCl absorption. This is then followed by a description of clinical uses for carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Many of the uses and effects of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can be predicted from an understanding of renal physiology and the role of carbonic anhydrase. The limited potency of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors correlates well with the large magnitude of carbonic anhydrase-independent bicarbonate absorption. While theories for carbonic anhy-drase-independent bicarbonate absorption are presented, the exact mechanisms remain unresolved.citations_number: 992Citation: Drugs, their targets and the nature and number of drug targets http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4b711581d93aed373b3648a70b90db05Hypoxia activates the capacity of tumor-associated carbonic anhydrase IX to acidify extracellular pH http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6b203f1a3ed6eb263ea53c6102f02827Carbonic anhydrases: current state of the art, therapeutic applications and future prospects http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=431d553969cb0acb283b0b04e932e179Urease as a virulence factor in experimental cryptococcosis. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cb81f23588048766d23fdaf2ac76ba28Interfering with pH regulation in tumours as a therapeutic strategy. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5d3d84ba7bafa8bbe93725bc521b593aInterfering with pH regulation in tumours as a therapeutic strategy http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f2ef406f8cd25ec8f50156ad012f1c36Anticancer and Antiviral Sulfonamides http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9e96d1e011a090fd1ca7badc1eac9291Unexpected Nanomolar Inhibition of Carbonic Anhydrase by COX-2-Selective Celecoxib: New Pharmacological Opportunities Due to Related Binding Site Recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5b561078111ecfe9c6f157f7790cc0c7Carbonic anhydrases as targets for medicinal chemistry. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a286bf6e4ada7709b14d6c66e8d57d90Carbonic Anhydrases An Overview http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e501264b4cf093c6ac730ad16804fd83References: Carbonic anhydrase: chemistry, physiology, and inhibition. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0ffd63597dd49b71a78683896aa3f5dfThe response of laryngeal afferent fibres to mechanical and chemical stimuli http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b702874dcf1bea2472714d4a7c3532a2Carbonic anhydrase as a tool in studying the mechanism of reactions involving H(2)CO(3), CO(2) or HCO(3)'. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c8796cf768eecdc6621e40cd0ea327e3Quantitative determination of glutamine and glutamic acid. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bd18afd105dc72b4718320fc1c19520bThienothiopyran-2-sulfonamides: a novel class of water-soluble carbonic anhydrase inhibitors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=91ee6a6b091c28c89ea3b8c2e83551faThe transcorneal permeability of sulfonamide carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and their effect on aqueous humor secretion http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8aa0acd07e9ce61498c7b0ad0b841e07Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase by sulphonamides http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=40e899083b2dd765f9c67811ab101768Synthesis of glutamic acid in animal tissues. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=78c815a0e77caed259db0b167d0aa873Note on the manometric determination of succinic and alpha-ketoglutaric acids. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7e41485342fe742406858f582161d078Carbonic anhydrase: An insight into the zinc binding site and into the active cavity through metal substitution http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f121302c6955d37dd5a237f8b99e8a07ChemInform Abstract: Thienothiopyran-2-sulfonamides: A Novel Class of Water-Soluble Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1cdc0a181de633e1f16144bce0057c81Function of proximal tubule carbonic anhydrase defined by selective inhibition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ed9906da3d1c1b9394b8726f75deb26cDextran-bound inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2e2f583247bbd5a274f7926d674e6465Effects of dextran-bound inhibitors on carbonic anhydrase activity in isolated rat lungs. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9101d2d203b8b9241fe8ea52324a52acIn vitro activity of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors against Neisseria meningitidis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3d1e3773490faa79efcbfdca749ac44eENTRAPMENT OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE ACTIVE SITE OF CARBONIC ANHYDRASE II* Domsic, John F.1\u00b6, Balendu Sankara Avvaru1\u00b6, Chae Un Kim2, Sol M.
