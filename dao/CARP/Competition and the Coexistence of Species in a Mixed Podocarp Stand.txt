name: Competition and the Coexistence of Species in a Mixed Podocarp Standurl: http://www.jstor.org/stable/2261099public_in: JSTORauthors: Richard P. Duncan,abstract: (1) The importance of intra- and interspecific competition in affecting the growth and survival of Dacrycarpus dacrydioides and Dacrydium cupressinum, the two dominant trees in a mixed podocarp stand in Ohinemaka Forest, south Westland, New Zealand, was investigated. Two lines of evidence (spatial patterning of trees and correlates of tree performance with neighbourhood density) were used to infer the importance of competition. (2) Intraspecific competition among D. dacrydioides trees appeared to be intense. Mean radial growth rate (MGR) was significantly negatively correlated with the number of conspecific neighbours, and patterns of non-random mortality resulted in a shift in spatial pattern from a significantly clumped to a significantly regular distribution. In contrast, intraspecific competition among D. cupressinum was less intense. D. cupressinum had a low rate of mortality, predominatly random spatial patterns of mortality, and a weak correlation between MGR and the number of conspecific neighbours. (3) Differences in the relative importance of intraspecific competition in affecting survival and growth of the two species was attributed to differences in the distribution and availability of suitable establishment sites. D. dacrydioides preferentially established on abundant level or slightly elevated sites, and in patches reached densities where resources were limiting. In contrast, the number and distribution of D. cupressinum were determined primarily by the availability of suitable elevated establishment sites that were scattered throughout the stand. The restricted number of suitable sites limited D. cupressinum to densities where resources were not severely limiting. (4) There was no evidence of interspecific competition. Rather the two species avoided interspecific competition by partitioning the variability in forest-floor micro-relief. Partitioning of sites may permit the coexistence of the two species.citations_number: 270Citation: Competition and Facilitation: A Synthetic Approach to Interactions in Plant Communities http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c359b04e0e47af3b6610f8a02d4f875bA Re-Assessment of High Elevation Treeline Positions and Their Explanation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b572dc8b42ec2bc72819e1170e13c8d7Spatial Patterns in the Distribution of Tropical Tree Species http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=22f4855f24aa4914d84d9e14dd8b0244North\u2013South Precipitation Patterns in Western North America on Interannual-to-Decadal Timescales http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8a7fb6220d37b0b65566085f475f4379Geostatistical patterns of soil heterogeneity around individual perennial plants http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5da41435de6936a846895cc5b0a5ebf6Soil nutrients influence spatial distributions of tropical tree species. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0cfd4e885dd35be53d0397717efa4468Identifying Forest Reference Conditions on Early Cut-over Lands, Lake Tahoe Basin, USA http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=10f33bce3f25d1cad9fa71fc4a88bca7Competition and Facilitation on Elevation Gradients in Subalpine Forests of the Northern Rocky Mountains, USA http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a71e27d8e6ced741a629d7f2b6f40bf7Species-area Curves, Spatial Aggregation, and Habitat Specialization in Tropical Forests http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=669546c2d5974ae21bbbfb0bc15a5db5DEMOGRAPHY OF A SAVANNA PALM TREE: PREDICTIONS FROM COMPREHENSIVE SPATIAL PATTERN ANALYSES http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=da2a1dc8b6b07b4a862b499f1a0a7872References: Modelling Spatial Patterns http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=db8ecbf6a0b7afb10d94ab0b540d42e8Spatial data analysis by example.
