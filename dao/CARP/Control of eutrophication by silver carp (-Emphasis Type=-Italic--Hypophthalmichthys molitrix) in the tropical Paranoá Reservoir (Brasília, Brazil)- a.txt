name: Control of eutrophication by silver carp (<Emphasis Type="Italic">Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) in the tropical Paranoá Reservoir (Brasília, Brazil): a mesocosm experimenturl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00765007public_in: Springerauthors: Fernando Luís do Rêgo Monteiro Starling,abstract: A mesocosm experiment was conducted to assess the impact of moderate silver carp ( Hypophthalmichthys molitrix ) biomass (41 g m −3  or 850 kg ha −1 ) on the plankton community and water quality of eutrophic Paranoá Reservoir (Brasília, Brazil). Microzooplankton (copepod nauplii and rotifers  20 μm), total phytoplankton biomass (expressed as chlorophyll- a ) and net primary productivity were significantly reduced by silver carp. Apart from increased nitrogen in the sediment, nutrients and chemical properties of the water were not affected by fish presence. The observed improvements in water quality suggest that stocking silver carp in Paranoá Reservoir to control blue-green algae is a promising biomanipulation practice.citations_number: 212Citation: Restoration of shallow lakes by nutrient control and biomanipulation - The successful strategy varies with lake size and climate http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=87602d35ccf27cdd02f983636176ad3d\u592a\u6e56\u5bcc\u8425\u517b\u5316\u4e0e\u84dd\u85fb\u6c34\u534e\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u996e\u7528\u6c34\u5371\u673a\u2014\u2014\u539f\u56e0\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7b56 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=99c584fff37e6b23e01861da6a004b6eRestoration of shallow lakes by nutrient control and biomanipulation\u2014the successful strategy varies with lake size and climate http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b19a78bc68ccafc6e94c571e56755f20\u7528\u9ca2\u9cd9\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u5fae\u56ca\u85fb\u6c34\u534e\u7684\u56f4\u9694\u8bd5\u9a8c\u548c\u6e56\u6cca\u5b9e\u8df5 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=139b863ebd1e37e48f6501e7d5f17cecEcological food webs: high-quality data facilitate theoretical unification http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=79ea3a63351b6d1bfa63449c1c0a1f62A taxonomic wish-list for community ecology. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f1675fd6b544a7b9bba261c88cd8f6e9\u84dd\u85fb\u6c34\u534e\u7684\u5371\u5bb3\u53ca\u6cbb\u7406\u52a8\u6001 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2175bd31834c12156a3b25728f66d199Ecological interactions between Nile tilapia ( Oreochromis niloticus , L.) and the phytoplanktonic community of the Furnas Reservoir (Brazil) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2f791170aa39055a0a8804d5f8cafece\u6e56\u6cca\u653e\u517b\u6e14\u4e1a\u5bf9\u6211\u56fd\u6e56\u6cca\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2cad1e897aa36982c28f60912437a518Size-spectra as indicators of the effects of fishing on coral reef fish assemblages http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9383ee7dfce3da5b96149ec760561bd4References: Standard methods for the examination of water and waste water http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f2a955ac7733a3498e52aa4e954669a5Trophic Relationships in Freshwater Pelagic Ecosystems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=62d54b00ab98c5802d1cbc8ba9ec7972A review of planktivorous fishes: Their evolution, feeding behaviours, selectivities, and impacts http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0e5bdd128007d2538e395283c309ba94Capture Probability: The Role of Zooplankter Escape in the Selective Feeding of Planktivorous Fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=73238f2968c036f556c8cb0a787329aaRelative Importance of Phosphorus Supply to Phytoplankton Production: ... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=17e8dfa2051ec904383258655fc9d737Zooplankton and Trophic State Relationships in Florida Lakes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=34593d9e8bdb254fc015f951189fbd2dFood habits and growth of silver and bighead carp in cages and ponds http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=889a5a2ac8a44f633ec474ae2bcc90daPrey Selection by Freshwater Predators with Different Foraging Strategies http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3867030db9af45472c43536961838708Selective Impact of Filter-Feeding Gizzard Shad on Zooplankton Community Structure http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4d2312e52f54a237c79bc4e33a0cfbf2Experimental study of the impacts of planktivorous fishes on plankton community and eutrophication of a tropical Brazilian reservoir http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ce2e81f15784d630517bc1ac42923434Chloroform\u2013Methanol Extraction of Chlorophyll a http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=069a5de2a9ad9684fa2f0ac7a6673ee7Applicability of planktonic biomanipulation for managing eutrophication in the subtropics http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9e1df4a3a776c9eac3c93d3ea91175dbTropical lakes \u2014 functional ecology and future development:.
