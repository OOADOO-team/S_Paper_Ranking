name: Recombinant Carp Parvalbumin, the Major Cross-Reactive Fish Allergen: A Tool for Diagnosis and Therapy of Fish Allergyurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM11971005public_in: 万方authors: Ines Swoboda,Agnes Bugajska-Schretter,Petra Verdino,abstract: Type I allergy is an immunologically-mediated hypersensitivity disease with complex genetic background affecting almost 25% of the population (Kay, 1997; Lockey and Bukantz, 1998). As a major feature of their disease, allergic patients produce IgE antibodies against per se mostly harmless antigens (i.e., allergens) which, after allergen-binding, can activate effector and inducer cells of the...
