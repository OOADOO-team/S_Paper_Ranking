name: Terbium replacement of calcium in carp muscle calcium-binding parvalbumin: an x-ray crystallographic study.url: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002228367590162Xpublic_in: Elsevierauthors: Moews PC,Kretsinger RH,abstract: Two calcium ions are bound by carp muscle calcium-binding parvalbumin. One is completely surrounded by protein ligands and not exposed to the solvent. The second has one water molecule in the primary co-ordination sphere. The latter, solvent accessible calcium ion, can be replaced by terbium in conditions where the internal ion is not replaced.citations_number: 279Citation: Repetitive zinc-binding domains in the protein transcription factor IIIA from Xenopus oocytes. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=139652115e9e1982320a5a7bb3b1b6e5Aromatic-aromatic interaction: a mechanism of protein structure stabilization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=32e36cebde6a052bcb02ebf0f04f0923Interior and surface of monomeric proteins. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f467523019124f37768fac72b77aaa63Structure And Evolution Of Calcium-Modulated Protein http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c8fddc7eb5795b17a0c6fbe8d21fa2faLanthanide ion probes of structure in biology.
