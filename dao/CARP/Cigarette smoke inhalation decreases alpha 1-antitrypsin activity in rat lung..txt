name: Cigarette smoke inhalation decreases alpha 1-antitrypsin activity in rat lung.url: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM316187public_in: 万方authors: Janoff A,Carp H,Lee DK,abstract: Brief inhalation exposure of rats to three or six puffs of cigarette smoke significantly decreases elastase inhibitory capacity per milligram of α _{1}$-antitrypsin in lung lavage fluid. This effect is not observed in ozone-tolerant rats and can be reversed by treating the lung lavage fluid from smoke-exposed rats with reducing agents. Samples of human serum obtained immediately after smoking also show decreased elastase inhibitory capacity per milligram of α _{1}$-antitrypsin. Again, elastase inhibitory capacity can be restored by treatment with a reducing agent. Cigarette smoking may cause emphysema by inactivating α _{1}$-antitrypsin through oxidation.citations_number: 234Citation: Human Plasma Proteinase Inhibitors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c626a0d1c2a75245245c4c214e080196Free-radical chemistry of cigarette smoke and its toxicological implications. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=620c73734c534d39665a8179f665bcd9Macrophages and polymorphonuclear neutrophils in lung defense and injury http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0ec3f2fa31cf2bc96ad34cce2e98ef3dCigarette smoking, emphysema, and damage to alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a8e6d2ba2646d8c6e9d78159799eea29Elastases and emphysema.
