name: ‘Classical’ and ‘non-classical’ reproductive steroids in fishurl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00045230public_in: Springerauthors: David E. Kime,abstract: The nature of the steroids secreted by gonads of fish differs significantly from those of the mammals. The ‘classical teleost steroids’, oestradiol, testosterone, 11-ketotestosterone and 17,20βP, have been measured in a wide variety of teleosts but do not always reflect biological activities. There is increasing evidence that teleost gonads may produce a number of ‘non-classical steroids’ which may play an important role in their reproductive biology. Such products include metabolites reduced at C5 to 5α or 5β, at C3 to 3α or 3β, or hydroxylated at 6-, 7-, or 21. Conjugation, as either glucuronides or sulphates, may contribute either to localization of action within the gonad or to production of pheromones during the immediate pre-spawning period. Although it is often possible only to measure the steroids for which assays are readily available, it is important to recognize that there may be production of steroids that are not detected by such assays, but which nevertheless play a major role in reproductive activity. In evolutionary terms, the teleost hydroxylases probably originated in the very early fishes and show parallels with their analogues in amphibians and mammals. Gene sequencing may reveal a possible common ancestor for all vertebrate 6, 7 and 11-hydroxylases.citations_number: 228Citation: Evolution of the nuclear receptor superfamily: early diversification from an ancestral orphan receptor http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c52c923bb450b561abd1c9b524b5fbfaEndocrine and environmental aspects of sex differentiation in fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=651b84bafd74679764a3a72bef7a40baEndocrine sex control strategies for the feminization of teleost fish. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7a6e90238a7a0327ef96ab68b6624a3aNeuroendocrine regulation of ovulation in fishes: basic and applied aspects http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=92edaab68edaba1bf17df8de6f1c4749The effects of pollution on reproduction in fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4792d69d369974340958a7aa85409ecaSocial modulation of sex steroid concentrations in the urine of male cichlid fish Oreochromis mossambicus. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=577779e76be2621fed5fc86bff40061aStatus and opportunities for genomics research with rainbow trout. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fd6ec71aebe4684d7a4fdb460970cff7Steroids in aquatic invertebrates http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=71bfa4ccb2437e5ecb198db3a9da51b9Effects of endocrine disrupters on sex steroid synthesis and metabolism pathways in fish. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dd4fa575cffcb3b6c6683a1dda060591Changes in the Expression of Genes Encoding Steroidogenic Enzymes in the Channel Catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) Ovary Throughout a Reproductive Cycle1 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b6667b33afbdd2c67b30875135dae6cReferences: 7 The Gonadal Steroids http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ab47e3e9443bf3c79dcdc8523bc32ae58 Yolk Formation and Differentiation in Teleost Fishes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c5004606bdff1880e01c4b522aa0d592Estradiol-17 beta production in amago salmon (Oncorhynchus rhodurus) ovarian follicles: role of the thecal and granulosa cells http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dbdad2ec08a69698802ed0eb846c2a5e5 Teleost Gonadotropins: Isolation, Biochemistry, and Function http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c738a031193edb591d5ce405dce0af15Plasma 17\u03b1,20\u03b2-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one levels during sexual maturation of amago salmon ( Oncorhynchus rhodurus ): Correlation with plasma gonadotropin and in vitro production by ovarian follicles http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dde28a87633379e68b6e8f229f95400717 alpha,20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one: plasma levels during sexual maturation and in vitro production by the testes of amago salmon (Oncorhynchus rhodurus) and rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7262fd41aee968b20596006b4aa60493Hormone changes during ovulation in the rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri Richardson) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=561ad2d7c70bac0a5f64992a78ca1ce5Relative in vitro effectiveness of 17 alpha, 20 beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one and other pregnene derivatives on germinal vesicle breakdown in oocytes of a... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=91fb0e3337b2963ec6ef7dbe7c7c6bedEstradiol-17 beta production in isolated amago salmon (Oncorhynchus rhodurus) ovarian follicles and its stimulation by gonadotropins http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f04129b52c1a93eec7768d4f2ea67515Seasonal variations in parameters of milt production and in plasma concentration of sex steroids of male rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri). http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=69e2696d15bbc2c514dba7b09eba0644Seasonal patterns of free and conjugated androgens in the brown trout Salmo trutta. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cd6f38dd32065cbc70f8c860c0c10061Inhibitory effect of cyanoketone on salmon gonadotropin-induced estradiol-17 beta production by ovarian follicles of the amago salmon (Oncorhynchus rhodurus) in vitro http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c4058d5cd0908991550d24210543cf9aCharacterization of membrane receptor activity for 17 alpha, 20 beta, 21-trihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one in ovaries of spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus). http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9f812b0087d719e6286c728e18641a8cUltrastructural changes in the adenohypophysis during the ovarian cycle of the viviparous teleost Poecilia latipinna : III.
