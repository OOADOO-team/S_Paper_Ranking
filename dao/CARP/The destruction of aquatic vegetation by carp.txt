name: The destruction of aquatic vegetation by carpurl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00016414public_in: Springerauthors: Alain J. Crivelli,abstract: The destruction of submerged vegetation by common carp, Cyprinus carpio  L. is tested in six enclosures with different biomass (kg ha âˆ’1 ) of carp in a marsh of the Camargue, southern France. After 71 days, a strong negative relationship was found between the biomass of carp and the amount of aquatic vegetation present in the enclosures. The results are compared with similar studies in the United States. The absence of problem of vegetation destruction by carp in Europe, in contrast to North America, may be explained by lower biomass of these populations in Europe, and by a higher weight of carp in North America.citations_number: 245Citation: Pathways of Increased Water Clarity After Fish Removal from Ventura Marsh; a Shallow, Eutrophic Wetland http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d8cb5d985cdb8469c583130736f9fa5fGlobal Invasions Of Marine And Estuarine Habitats By Non-Indigenous Species: Mechanisms, Extent, And Consequences http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8bac8011e997d4ee10e8df09c2d12877Competition Among Refuging Sunfishes and Effects of Fish Density on Littoral Zone Invertebrates http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=80579e8da4814c03570d9ec9ae8b5140Multiplicity of stable states in freshwater systems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d5c2deee5a1361e17fe4f365738b6674Non\u2010indigenous species as stressors in estuarine and marine communities: Assessing invasion impacts and interactions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=41a2815d892773c885e0b1e436418608To be, or not to be, a non&#x2010;native freshwater fish? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fb365503d042afc231623b0623bac6faTo be, or not to be, a non\u2010native freshwater fish? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7f03de6fba0720405880968e1831e41eIs reduction of the benthivorous fish an important cause of high transparency following biomanipulation in shallow lakes? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fa310303685d6c16e5a93765dbd56c1dFish Utilization of Great Lakes Coastal Wetlands http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0e1de2aadb60582b450211de79011856Long-term response of the biotic community to fluctuating water levels and changes in water quality in Cootes Paradise Marsh, a degraded coastal wetland of... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4bc9b60c41fd12f2897e3562d21cb95fReferences: The trophic-dynamic aspect of ecology http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fd861df10d03d0f729412bbcaf9f733eCalculation of instantaneous birth rate http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=091b12c12a51e74b291c91d6d13ee559The Effect of Carp on a Small Lake: the Carp as a Dominant http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b682f81be8387a2a1a4b87d1227bcb36Effect of Carp on Vegetation in a Lake Erie Marsh http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d73f206fcf3c7e74ee9089f884bc98beCommercial Carp Removal at Lake Mattamuskeet, North Carolina http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3039dab3aee3e11c8fdc7afa8fb0933fThe Increase in Game-Fish Populations in East Okoboji Lake, Iowa, following Intensive Removal of Rough Fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fe79f8858d16a10ce37c5be682d4116fEffects of Grass Carp and Carp on Populations of Bluegill and Largemouth Bass in Ponds http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d52aaeac29c70fd33f1448aa8a011afbpeuplements de poissons de la Camargue http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=03950500fff57258761b7428d6105727Changes in the fish community of Lake Carl Blackwell, Oklahoma (1967-77) and a test of the reproductive guild concept. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=954b3ff11472a005e78a9c871d2b6654An Experiment in Removing Coarse Fish from a Lake http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4281d2eb70dfe9f27fe89786d33ca7b6The ecology and use of carp in Utah. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=faff1eeffbe46d226eb53ba1001cf6e1
