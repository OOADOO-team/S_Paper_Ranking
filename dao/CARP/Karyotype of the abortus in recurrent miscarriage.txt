name: Karyotype of the abortus in recurrent miscarriageurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM11287018public_in: 万方authors: Howard Carp,Vladimir Toder,Ayala Aviram,abstract: Objective: To assess the chromosomal aberrations in the abortus in recurrent miscarriage and the live birth rate after a euploid or aneuploid miscarriage. Design: Retrospective analysis. Setting: Tertiary referral unit in university hospital. Patient(s): One hundred sixty-seven patients with 3 to 16 miscarriages before 20 weeks. Intervention(s): Material collected at curettage from 167 abortuses was analyzed by standard G-banding techniques. Main Outcome Measure(s): The incidence of aberrations and the outcome of the subsequent pregnancy were assessed according to the embryonic karyotype. Result(s): In this study 125 specimens were successfully karyotyped. Of these, 29% (36 of 125) had chromosome aberrations; 94% of the aberrations were aneuploidy, and 6% were structural. The most prevalent anomalies were chromosome 16, 18, and 21 trisomies, triploidy, and monosomy X. After an aneuploid miscarriage, there was a 68% subsequent live birth rate (13 of 19) compared to the 41% (16 of 39) rate after a euploid abortion. Conclusion(s): The low (29%) incidence of aberrations indicates that alternative mechanisms may be responsible for the majority of recurrent miscarriages. These figures provide a basis for assessing the efficacy of therapy for recurrent miscarriage. If further studies confirm that patients with karyotypically abnormal fetuses have a good prognosis, an informed decision can be made as to whether further investigations and treatment should be undertaken.citations_number: 323Citation: Milder ovarian stimulation for in-vitro fertilization reduces aneuploidy in the human preimplantation embryo: a randomized controlled trial http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3ce1477aa9d7d4728dca0d9f7c6546fbCo-expression of two perivascular cell markers isolates mesenchymal stem-like cells from human endometrium http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4982947dc12741be0152e5ee8af3b2c1Cyclic AMP and progesterone receptor cross-talk in human endometrium: a decidualizing affair http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ab679e2ff2b18203b8924898b6aae62aEarly embryo cleavage is a strong indicator of embryo quality in human IVF. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0bbbf0c8c677e39be5af95bb24f159a3Retrospective and Prospective Epidemiological Studies of 1500 Karyotyped Spontaneous Human Abortions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b9e840e3217a1b127ecbf40f53107e25Karyotype of the abortus in recurrent miscarriage. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b93788caaabdcad53ad961d0c3e4d0b1Aspects of biopsy procedures prior to preimplantation genetic diagnosis. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fab9924b7818d7e8e62efc67eae50b75An update in recurrent spontaneous abortion. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b8cf5cb6a0194dd89f2e9698cf00da83Can biological or clinical parameters predict testicular sperm recovery in 47,XXY Klinefelter\u2019s syndrome patients? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7f9e91823cde71cb2f82043a9f7e0cbcImproved implantation after preimplantation genetic diagnosis of aneuploidy. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cbd47d5d9690def54d7d96a920d9274eReferences: Trisomy in Man http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bc48a10963cdfa75d6fa42ebf6283770Embryonic karyotype of abortuses in relation to the number of previous miscarriages http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=73d5c70b30849e484c3c523f2152437dKaryotype of the abortus in recurrent miscarriage. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b93788caaabdcad53ad961d0c3e4d0b1Aspects of biopsy procedures prior to preimplantation genetic diagnosis. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fab9924b7818d7e8e62efc67eae50b75Chromosome abnormalities in human arrested preimplantation embryos: a multiple-probe FISH study. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8d571287bc9f38684a9952c4483982acThe immunolocalization of bcl-2 at the maternal-fetal interface in healthy and failing pregnancies. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8a4c0e4c5a6b9f9f8cf23a1b84664350The meiotic stage of nondisjunction in trisomy 21: Determination by using DNA polymorphisms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9aceeaedfd2ca089ea90a6a346d8f34eAdvanced maternal age and the risk of Down syndrome characterized by the meiotic stage of chromosomal error: a population-based study http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=363324d0cc4a4fb0afcf4a2fb9a0152dFrequency of abnormal karyotypes among abortuses from women with and without a history of recurrent spontaneous abortion * http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f88adbac43cbb035c4574ef3bcdb521dRobertsonian translocations\u2014reproductive risks and indications for preimplantation genetic diagnosis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=34fc5e343458373cc7fe82f9884037f8Detection of chromosomal aberration in fetuses arising from recurrent spontaneous abortion by comparative genomic hybridization. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=80bd8428d5080c4fb6b469dfb6d53ca9Does the karyotype of a spontaneous abortion predict the karyotype of a subsequent abortion?
