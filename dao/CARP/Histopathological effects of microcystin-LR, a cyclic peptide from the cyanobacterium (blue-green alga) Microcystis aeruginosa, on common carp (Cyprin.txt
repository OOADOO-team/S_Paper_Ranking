name: Histopathological effects of microcystin-LR, a cyclic peptide from the cyanobacterium (blue-green alga) Microcystis aeruginosa, on common carp (Cyprinus carpio L. )url: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166445X9190012Xpublic_in: Elsevierauthors: RABERGH,C. M. I,abstract: ABSTRACT  The toxic effects of microcystin-LR, a cyclic peptide hepatotoxin produced by the cosmopolitan cyano-bacterium Microcystis aeruginosa, were studied by intraperitoneal injections in common carp Cyprinus carpio L. The lowest consistently lethal dose was 550 μg/kg whereas fish injected with doses ranging from 130–300 μg/kg survived the seven day experiment. Histological examination of vital organs (liver, kidney. heart, intestine, spleen and brain) in fish injected with sublethal doses of the toxin, revealed severe liver damage with dissociation of the hepatocytes and hydropic degeneration. In addition, in the kidney the Bowman&#039;s capsules of the glomeruli were dilated. In fish injected with a lethal dose of microcystin-LR a total loss of the liver parenchymal architecture and degeneration of the kidney tubuli were observed. The progression of organ damage was studied by electron microscopy of the liver ultrastructure and by blood plasma activity measurements of enzyme indicators. Swollen mitochondria, dissociation of hepatocytes and vesiculation of RER were observed already at 30 min post-injection. Elevated enzyme activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) were measured in the plasma of all fish injected with microcystin-LR. The study shows that MC-LR may in fish, in analogy with its extreme hepatotoxic potential in mammals, cause severe liver damage. In addition, the toxin shows in fish a strong impact on elements of the kidney.citations_number: 225Citation: The Effects of Harmful Algal Blooms on Aquatic Organisms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=33d272b98ae259142c70fb3bf203b351Taylor & Francis Online :: The Effects of Harmful Algal Blooms on Aquatic Organisms - Reviews in Fisheries Science - Volume 10, Issue 2 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=996ce68bc45eb6c40160ef24b4256502Cyanobacterial toxins: Occurrence, properties and biological significance http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d403b9ae61a34398bb16c9baf9ce4affSensitive detection of apoptogenic toxins in suspension cultures of rat and salmon hepatocytes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=59d450632a9779ab87bfd9258181ee33Toxicology and risk assessment of freshwater cyanobacterial (blue-green algal) toxins in water http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=48100c48655836d91245c98c50d3274dToxicology and Risk Assessment of Freshwater Cyanobacterial (Blue-Green Algal) Toxins in Water http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=71da39904fa708d19dba10cdf658be4fEcotoxicological effects of selected cyanobacterial secondary metabolites: a short review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=066ac75f721861940f6569245c189105Pathological and biochemical characterization of microcystin-induced hepatopancreas and kidney damage in carp (Cyprinus carpio) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=be5ba057e6c8bbb598b02be5555aa3b1Hepatotoxic cyanobacteria: a review of the biological importance of microcystins in freshwater environments. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=01794330e479fa121990dcf843feae6dA review of cyanobacterial odorous and bioactive metabolites: Impacts and management alternatives in aquaculture http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2680334f59a9fbed93e45382b0911213References: Cyanobacterial microcystin-LR is a potent and specific inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A from both mammals and higher plants. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7a8516d958bd34b4898aebe673d2b70bEffects of the tumour promoter okadaic acid on intracellular protein phosphorylation and metabolism http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c2831dd7c91437dc8fa285c8f0390830Nodularin, microcystin, and the configuration of Adda http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bd95b4669f4fda1911f1c78930b64971Naming of cyclic heptapeptide toxins of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=64b8b22df57d82540d3ac48765437a45Improved method for purification of toxic peptides produced by cyanobacteria. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2ff5138778f53d4be25700e4b5719b7aChemInform Abstract: Nodularin, Microcystin, and the Configuration of Adda http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f0fb5671be1473427378edb38592bcaeAmatoxins, phallotoxins, phallolysin, and antamanide: the biologically active components of poisonous Amanita mushrooms. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=105668a1d01a3484c44a8dbb21639af7Hepatocellular uptake of 3H-dihydromicrocystin-LR, a cyclic peptide toxin http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4ee0dc3e2cdcf87f902c726e3cb2e8aeBlood pressure and hepatocellular effects of the cyclic heptapeptide toxin produced by the freshwater cyanobacterium (blue - green alga) Microcystis aerugi... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ff41275e46982465591d68713b212a73Hepatocyte deformation induced by cyanobacterial toxins reflects inhibition of protein phosphatases http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=75e4252f7ed158b5ce89b66d4bedbbf4Toxic Blue-Green Algal Blooms in Europe: A Growing Problem http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c326735435ce7d5e2057b9346cc69cd9Toxic peptides from freshwater cyanobacteria (blue-green algae).
