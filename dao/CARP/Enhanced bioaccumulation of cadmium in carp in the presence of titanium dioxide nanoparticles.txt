name: Enhanced bioaccumulation of cadmium in carp in the presence of titanium dioxide nanoparticlesurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653506011805public_in: Elsevierauthors: Xuezhi Zhang, Hongwen Sun, Zhiyan Zhang,abstract: In this study adsorption of Cd onto TiO2 nanoparticles and natural sediment particles (SP) were studied and the facilitated transports of Cd into carp by TiO2 nanoparticles and SP were assessed by bioaccumulation tests exposing carp (Cyprinus carpio) to Cd contaminated water in the presence of TiO2 and SP respectively. The results show that TiO2 nanoparticles had a significantly stronger adsorption capacity for Cd than SP. The presence of SP did not have significant influence on the accumulation of Cd in carp during the 25 d of exposure. However, the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles greatly enhanced the accumulation of Cd in carp. After 25 d of exposure Cd concentration in carp increased by 146%, and the value was 22.3 and 9.07 Î¼g/g, respectively. And there is a positive correlation between Cd and TiO2 concentration. Considerable Cd and TiO2 accumulated in viscera and gills of the fish.citations_number: 261Citation: Environmental behavior and ecotoxicity of engineered nanoparticles to algae, plants, and fungi http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ff9f9681ab96ef43e12783d7d89c33e2The ecotoxicology and chemistry of manufactured nanoparticles. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4c9715f2399f2e6cfe86e20f836767a9Manufactured nanoparticles: An overview of their chemistry, interactions and potential environmental implications http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dad8cebcea63c2bededa0b3def6ef7f7Toxicity of titanium dioxide nanoparticles to rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ): Gill injury, oxidative stress, and other physiological effects http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=148dffe4c0728b856678b9a986374036Ecotoxicity of engineered nanoparticles to aquatic invertebrates: a brief review and recommendations for future toxicity testing http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=504d422bdec4637587f41902892f3632Detection and characterization of engineered nanoparticles in food and the environment http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b609443a19622a7aedb0bf83e0a95d0cToxicity and bioaccumulation of xenobiotic organic compounds in the presence of aqueous suspensions of aggregates of nano-C 60 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=459b5092028b486d503045e8cc2598cfEmulsions stabilised by food colloid particles: role of particle adsorption and wettability at the liquid interface. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2217a3819a809a57607250aee0401709Toxicity and bioaccumulation of TiO2 nanoparticle aggregates in Daphnia magna http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f239a37e33a532694631417ce3e2f586Effects of nano-scale TiO2, ZnO and their bulk counterparts on zebrafish: acute toxicity, oxidative stress and oxidative damage http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1751168780e5c509329c39423cdc7088References: Subsurface transport of contaminants http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=987d700c0e8b624990da35d72f7be56aES&T Features: Subsurface transport of contaminants http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cce76fa97c29bea8435f5f62e1739791Carbon nanotubes as superior sorbent for dioxin removal http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8aba3464a241691181161b9ce09ffa22Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4793aa3c79037de26fff54c215a92ddaSkin as a route of exposure and sensitization in chronic beryllium disease. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c3233b1f51a9d3969935aefd4f07a0e4Heterogeneous water phase catalysis as an environmental application: a review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a804e812b2253d355bc6b4c3a4e4c697Evidence That Ultrafine Titanium Dioxide Induces Micronuclei and Apoptosis in Syrian Hamster Embryo Fibroblasts http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a1d2b5796d457764b283306e3a837e4cPeer Reviewed: Environmental Technologies at the Nanoscale - Environmental Science & Technology (ACS Publications) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e4774ac2cb4386837f315bd79765c4efToxicology of Ultrafine Particles: In vivo Studies http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=47ceea2f65f1068f39ed5fb493945906
