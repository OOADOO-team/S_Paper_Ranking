name: Genetic manipulations in aquaculture: a review of stock improvement by classical and modern technologiesurl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1013776931796public_in: Springerauthors: G. Hulata,abstract: The aim of this review was to highlight the extent to which the genetic technologies are implemented by the aquaculture industry. The review shows that some of the modern genetic technologies are already extensively applied by the diverse aquaculture industries, though not to the same extent for all important aquacultured species (according to FAO 1998 figures). Some species (common carp, Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, channel catfish, Nile tilapia, and the Pacific oyster) received concentrated breeding efforts, while other major cultured species (Chinese and Indian carps and the giant tiger shrimp) received, so far, relatively limited attention, and a few species (Yesso scallop, blue mussel, white Amur bream, and milkfish) have, apparently, not been genetically improved at all. Most of the genetically improved strains reaching the aquaculture industry were developed through traditional selective breeding (selection, crossbreeding, and hybridization). Emerging, more modern technologies for genetic manipulation seem to take 10&amp;#x2013;20 years from being established experimentally until applications affect the industry. Thus, chromosome-set and sex manipulations started to affect the industry during the 1980&#039;&#039;s and 1990&#039;&#039;s. DNA marker technology and gene manipulations have yet hardly affected the industry. The former have not matured yet, but hold much promise. The latter could have affected the industry already had it not been restricted by public concern.citations_number: 299Citation: DNA marker technologies and their applications in aquaculture genetics http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4a63e3e6c8c7c06cce9eb676e3352d7cThe evolution of sex-biased genes and sex-biased gene expression. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0f9ae0d2a1e96e5c80dd36c626e86f18Microsatellites and their genomic distribution, evolution, function and applications: A review with special reference to fish genetics http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=210088f840b7dcd93ae82488f38b52d0Ecology.
