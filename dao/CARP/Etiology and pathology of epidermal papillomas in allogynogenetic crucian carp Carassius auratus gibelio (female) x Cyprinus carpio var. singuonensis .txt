name: Etiology and pathology of epidermal papillomas in allogynogenetic crucian carp Carassius auratus gibelio (female) x Cyprinus carpio var. singuonensis (male).url: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail?id=PeriodicalPaper_JJ028187246public_in: 万方authors: Lu H,Zhu G,Fan L,abstract: Allogynogenetic crucian carp Carassius auratus gibelio (female) x Cyprinus carpio var. singuonensis (male) is one of the main freshwater aquaculture species in China. In recent years, epidermal papillomas have been observed on the scales, fins and opercula of adult fish in many fish farms in the Chongming county of Shanghai, China. The disease appears in the late autumn of the first year and becomes more severe in winter. It gradually regresses in the late spring or summer of the second year, as water temperature increases. Our study revealed that the disease pathogen was likely to be a herpes-like virus, as indicated by enveloped viral particles in the cytoplasm, empty capsids in the nucleus and a virus-like morphology of the pathogen. The size of the enveloped herpes-like virus was 118.18 +/- 10.53 (SD) nm (n = 22) and its nucleocapsid was 78.64 +/- 7.74 nm (n = 22) in diameter. Histopathological examination of tumours revealed that both epithelial and stromal cells proliferated to form papillomas. The nuclei of epithelial tumour cells were irregular in shape and in size. Most of the mucous cells were located in clusters near the middle of each papilloma. Cytoplasmic organelles were sparse in tumour cells. Numerous granulocytes and lymphocytes infiltrated into the tumour tissue. There were no inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm and nuclei of tumour cells. The lesions only occurred in adult allogynogenetic crucian carp, even though they were cultured together with other fish species. There was marked variation in incidence: in some ponds, only a few fish were affected, while the incidence was up to 90% in other ponds.citations_number: 337Citation: Open channel structure of MscL and the gating mechanism of mechanosensitive channels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a158cfb4ad45d72feee50c5eb395b38dPhysical principles underlying the transduction of bilayer deformation forces during mechanosensitive channel gating. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=67835bfdeabbe8924c469db88993ce8fStructure of the KcsA channel intracellular gate in the open state http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f0fb83fb2b61a763a7b95487c711daffStructure of membrane-bound alpha-synuclein studied by site-directed spin labeling. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=041abd5fc038685215d803cb5903b980Structure of membrane-bound alpha-synuclein from site-directed spin labeling and computational refinement. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2431fcdbe4aead5c28192db4594f494cMembrane-protein interactions in cell signaling and membrane trafficking. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7a4d5b614dd721015a6e90a43f7fef3cElectron spin resonance in studies of membranes and proteins. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f2f9399b4354359a99bae3d4fb3ae0a6Peptide-membrane interactions and mechanisms of membrane destruction by amphipathic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d7de45aa07495dad0cab281c8ad26e95Molecular motion of spin labeled side chains in alpha-helices: analysis by variation of side chain structure http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4904e9f26a9a814989f7883879746103Structure and analysis of FCHo2 F-BAR domain: a dimerizing and membrane recruitment module that effects membrane curvature. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9ce9868fc805ad5934631120e95f802dReferences: Field and Laboratory Studies of Environmental Carcinogenesis in Niagara River Fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c406914d864b5c53f526c7b1d7ebd30eEthylnitrosourea Induces Neoplasia in Zebrafish (Danio rerio) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bd7188ee8c009b95b025a8b19981eb78Virus associated with epidermal hyperplasia in fish. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=37ddcc7054678f9b2e7a82087580ac79The infective agent in carp pox http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d06427db53d887d49ae81d38fd2d9d5Neoplastic response in Japanese medaka and channel catfish exposed to N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5ed240c70b27fe13ee339b8e11791066Electron microscopy on mucosal and cutaneous lesions in contagious papular dermatitis of Japanese Serow (Capricornis crispus). http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2007cb29bad568a605f938351543dcb3Histopathologic studies on mucosal and cutaneous lesions in contagious papular dermatitis of Japanese serow (Capricornis crispus). http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e87a9f48ecc4804e766a294dbb8e84a6Avian pox virus infection in a mourning dove http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d5960b1c891e05649ffcba63923bd51eSkin tumours of northern pike (Esox lucius L.).
