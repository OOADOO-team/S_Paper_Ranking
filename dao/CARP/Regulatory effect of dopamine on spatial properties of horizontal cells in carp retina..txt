name: Regulatory effect of dopamine on spatial properties of horizontal cells in carp retina.url: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM6726332public_in: 万方authors: Teranishi T,Negishi K,Kato S,abstract: Three types of light-induced response (L-, RG-, and YRB -type S-potentials) recorded from isolated retinas of the carp (Cyprinus carpio) were identified by their spectral response and later by morphological localization of the recording sites marked with an intracellular Lucifer Yellow (LY). Horizontal cells in a given layer, generating one of the above response types, are electrically coupled via gap junctions, so that the injected LY normally diffused to several neighboring cells. The spatial property of the three types of responses was examined by enlarging the diameter of a light spot (0.25 to 4.0 mm) and displacing the spot (0.5 mm diameter) along a straight 4-mm line which passed over the recording point at the middle. In normal retinas, the half-decay distance of response amplitude with spot displacement was shorter in the order of L-, RG-, and YRB -type responses, and correspondingly the dye diffusion area was narrower in the same order of cells. Dopamine (DA; 10 to 20 microM), applied to the vitreous fluid beneath the isolated retina, altered the spatial property of all types of responses by increasing the amplitude of responses to central spots and decreasing that of those to distant spots, and it restricted the intracellular LY to single injected cells. In contrast, in retinas from which DA interplexiform cells had been deprived by prior destruction with a neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine, the amplitude of responses became smaller while the half-decay distance was longer by 1.1- to 1.6-fold, depending upon the cell type, and the dye diffusion area in all types of cells became wider by 2-fold as compared to those in normal retinas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)citations_number: 182Citation: Microcircuitry of the dark-adapted cat retina: functional architecture of the rod-cone network. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=373122bd6ea448e8e23c82393809960eHemi-gap-junction channels in solitary horizontal cells of the catfish retina. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=31368d76a35edda39ed2a44a37199313Dopaminergic modulation of gap junction permeability between amacrine cells in mammalian retina. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3618c54c0f442d2e167979d13a751cf8Modulation of an electrical synapse between solitary pairs of catfish horizontal cells by dopamine and second messengers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=73bddf6af27c53415006f3abc89cad2aTransmitter circuits in the vertebrate retina. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=814c3efe69e54f0431ee58b8ec5f807fLocalization and function of dopamine in the adult vertebrate retina http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=41ba8d930a8100d202e76d6c0a6a8c45VISUAL DYSFUNCTION IN PARKINSON'S DISEASELOSS IN SPATIOTEMPORAL CONTRAST SENSITIVITY http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d5dc044ba8c3c94464c6206359285166Responsiveness and receptive field size of carp horizontal cells are reduced by prolonged darkness and dopamine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=13ec50b76e5bad2d81007a7b53d50dbdRod pathways in mammalian retinae http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bfc17e4371afbcc41ecca89f0b8be3feModulation of cone horizontal cell activity in the teleost fish retina.
