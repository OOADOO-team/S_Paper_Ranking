name: Neuropathological changes in scrapie and Alzheimer's disease are associated with increased expression of apolipoprotein E and cathepsin D in astrocytes.url: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM1870200public_in: 万方authors: J F Diedrich,H Minnigan,R I Carp,abstract: With the rationale that the neuropathological similarities between scrapie and Alzheimer&#039;s disease reflect convergent pathological mechanisms involving altered gene expression, we set out to identify molecular events involved in both processes, using scrapie as a model to study the time course of these changes. We differentially screened a cDNA library constructed from scrapie-infected mice to identify mRNAs that increase or decrease during disease and discovered in this way two mRNAs that are increased in scrapie and Alzheimer&#039;s disease. These mRNAs were subsequently shown by sequence analysis to encode apolipoprotein E and cathepsin D (EC 3.4.23.5). Using in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry to define the cellular and anatomic pathology of altered gene expression, we found that in both diseases the increase in apolipoprotein E and cathepsin D mRNAs and proteins occurred in activated astrocytes. In scrapie, the increase in gene expression occurred soon after the amyloid-forming abnormal isoform of the prion protein has been shown to accumulate in astrocytes. In Alzheimer&#039;s disease, the increased expression of cathepsin D also occurred in association with beta-amyloid. These studies reveal some of the molecular antecedents of neuropathological changes in scrapie and Alzheimer&#039;s disease and accord new prominence to the role of astrocytes in neurodegenerative conditions.citations_number: 392Citation: Binding of human apolipoprotein E to synthetic amyloid beta peptide: isoform-specific effects and implications for late-onset Alzheimer disease.
