name: The immune system of cyprinid fish. Kinetics and temperature dependence of antibody-producing cells in carp (Cyprinus carpio).url: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM7000695public_in: 万方authors: G T Rijkers,E M FrederixWolters,W B van Muiswinkel,abstract: After immunization of carp with sheep red blood cells, the spleen accounts for only 5% of the total number of plaque-forming cells (PFC). In addition, thymus, peripheral blood and heart contained low numbers of PFC (&lt; 0.5, 1 and 0.5%, respectively). Pronephros and mesonephros were the major antibody-forming organs (53 and 40% of total PFC, respectively). The temperature dependence of the antibody-forming cell response in spleen, pronephros and mesonephros as studied in animals kept at 12-24 degrees. Lowering temperatures induced a delay in the peak of the primary response but had no effect on the magnitude of the response. The temperature-peak day relationship indicated that there are steps in the primary immune response of carp differing in temperature sensitivity. The anamnestic character of the secondary response was clearly demonstrated at 24 and 20 degrees but lost at 18 degrees.citations_number: 207Citation: Temperature and teleost immune functions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6b0b7c003223fba70d98fe9509d29f46The immune system of cyprinid fish.
