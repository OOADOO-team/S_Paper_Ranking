The sensitivity of NMP22 for detection of transitional cell carcinoma in bladder cancer patients was as much as twice that of cytology when a reference value of 6.4 units per ml. was used. NMP22 analysis was less costly than cytology and operator independent. While NMP22 has previously been shown to be a strong predictor of recurrence after tumor resection, it is an effective and sensitive screening test for detecting tumors in patients with transitional cell carcinoma.citations_number: 217Citation: Bladder tumor markers beyond cytology: International Consensus Panel on bladder tumor markers. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=81a840ba4a2998bf61bf221f4407d36cComparison of screening methods in the detection of bladder cancer. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c508c5f9000eae6314b2e2e9ccde3984RE: URINE BASED MARKERS OF UROLOGICAL MALIGNANCY http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=be810650a2bb3f97480576660497d301Guidelines on bladder cancer. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=545a972ca43a5bb2c1023ad6ac7500c0Urinary hyaluronic acid and hyaluronidase: markers for bladder cancer detection and evaluation of grade. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=89db305b66862989468ec7b8baee23adSensitivity and specificity of commonly available bladder tumor markers versus cytology: results of a comprehensive literature review and meta-analyses http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3ceb0dd4bb263da49647434d6efa0100Diagnosis and management of superficial bladder cancer. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=62b6753172a87b6676ab98427695eedcEconomic aspects of bladder cancer: what are the benefits and costs? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a796b5e9978796e6ae4c06f8a1d16044The 2004 WHO classification of bladder tumors: a summary and commentary http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=42352f8cc27eaf207fb132ec7913224fUrine based markers of urological malignancy. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6eb7524cb93550e56c362454fcdac28eReferences: Telomerase activity in human ovarian carcinoma. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=98121120d8dc144ea09afa9f76203bc2Identification of a nuclear protein matrix http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=114e0a157488b22fd0f7b8183ef2f205fos-associated cellular p39 is related to nuclear transcription factor AP-1 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ee5f31d23a9c18d1bcd8c5c9c4b4a2d5Non-Invasive Papillary Carcinoma of the Bladder Associated with Carcinoma in Situ http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d18719861d2b82bfb186b6c755af5c2eResults of a Multicenter Trial using the BTA Test to Monitor for and Diagnose Recurrent Bladder Cancer http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0d0d80c32187dc65a775ec9b6eecf0f7Re: Results of a multicenter trial using the BTA test to monitor for and diagnose recurrent bladder cancer http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ed7dd20f45513dc2c86cba9df1ce8e83Prognostic parameters in superficial bladder cancer: an analysis of 315 cases. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=57a4e5b2d95bb09990a2675a26991a89Many monoclonal antibodies with an apparent specificity for certain lung cancers are directed against a sugar sequence found in lacto- N -fucopentaose III http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0a726ada35ab9377b30e3ec03835e49e
