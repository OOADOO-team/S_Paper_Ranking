name: Flood disturbance and the coexistence of species in a lowland podocarp forest, south Wetland, New Zealandurl: http://www.bioone.org/servlet/linkout?suffix=bibr08&amp;dbid=16&amp;doi=10.2980%2F20-2-3609&amp;key=10.2307%2F2261519public_in: BioOneauthors: DUNCAN,RP,abstract: 1. The structure and composition of four forest stands affected by catastrophic floods on a lowland floodplain, south Westland, New Zealand, was investigated using stand history reconstruction. Age and size structures, and tree locations were used to identify cohorts of trees that were initiated by flood events. This, along with information on species microsite preferences and spatial patterning, was used to reconstruct the patterns of establishment of the four dominant canopy trees (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides, Dacrydium cupressinum, Prumnopitys ferruginea and Weinmannia racemosa) in response to flood disturbance. 2. The four species coexisted by partitioning establishment sites with respect to the amount of overhead cover and the type of forest floor microsite. D. dacrydioides and D. cupressinum established in large gaps but colonized contrasting microsites; D. dacrydioides established mostly on mineral soil while D. cupressinum established on elevated microsites. W. racemosa and P. ferruginea both established on elevated microsites beneath largely intact forest canopies. However, W. racemosa colonized canopy gaps while P. ferruginea established mostly under closed cover. Disturbance was critical to the maintenance of species diversity because it was the source of much of the environmental variation to which species responded differentially. 3. Among plots, differences in forest structure and composition reflected the availability of sites suitable for the recruitment of each species. Site availability was in turn largely a consequence of disturbance history. Intense floods formed large gaps and left homogenous surface deposits of silt that became dominated by D. dacrydioides. Less-intense floods left exposed debris that provided additional establishment sites for D. cupressinum and for occasional P. ferruginea, while floods that left surviving canopy intact provided establishment opportunities for all four species. Recruitment into small canopy openings in developing stands was dominated by W. racemosa. 4. The importance of disturbance in influencing patterns of forest regeneration suggests that a model emphasizing the response of individuals to a fluctuating physical and biotic environment is appropriate for understanding the dynamics of these forests. Forest dynamics were a consequence of the differential response of species to changes in the nature of canopy gaps through time.citations_number: 237Citation: THE ECOLOGY OF INTERFACES:Riparian Zones http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d823e6ad417166c42c23079e88f863f1Structural determinants of water permeation through aquaporin-1. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f907f56931fb5ebf2b88d410f3698adfThe use of \u2018altitude\u2019 in ecological research http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=10a997b306482bc239c1d09c942bc634Acclimation and Adaptive Responses of Woody Plants to Environmental Stresses http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2a6ad19e2def3a189ccf0d2fcc5e3cb3PLANT REMOVALS IN PERENNIAL GRASSLAND: VEGETATION DYNAMICS, DECOMPOSERS, SOIL BIODIVERSITY, AND ECOSYSTEM PROPERTIES http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ad00f20929fc5d0246e7dfbe2ee2d660Ecological connectivity in alluvial river ecosystems and its disruption by flow regulation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=aa64b8c0157e7ccd927d845deb52f193Stand development in an old-growth subalpine forest in southern interior British Columbia http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bd9c929664f3af84111f55f8c4c665d2Evolution and distribution of the New Zealand flora, as affected by quaternary climates http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c5e25a177afb26bd98681507ad3b0f39Floodplain biogeomorphology http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5956a4cc6c122cd404371d4d57fdaef4References: Diversity in Tropical Rain Forests and Coral Reefs http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=40c3e8c46c4ac99300ea70d0df074f61Resource competition and community structure http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d8481b11d73e80cf4624e954f4c6e5f7Scientific Books: Plant Succession.
