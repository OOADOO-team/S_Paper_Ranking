Protein composition of the dystrophic muscle.url: http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/19721405473.htmlpublic_in: CAB Directauthors: WATANABE, T,TAKASHIMA, F,OGINO, C,abstract: Part 1 was ibid. (1970) 36, 972-976.2. Carp weighing 5 to 8 g were deprived of vitamin E for 90 days and showed apparent muscular dystrophy; control fish had a diet with α-tocopherol 50 mg/100 g. About 5 g pooled dorsal muscle was extracted and separated into 4 fractions, sarcoplasmic, myofibrillar, residual intracellular and stroma proteins. In dystrophic muscle the amount of total, myofibril...citations_number: 151Citation: The lipid composition and biochemistry of freshwater fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=38b3bb1371f693a57d1a9a4e5a0c45c6Nutritional values of live organisms used in Japan for mass propagation of fish: A review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ed5e5e6c285a15688dcc04082accd014Antioxidant Defenses in Fish: Biotic and Abiotic Factors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=543571a32acd3804ccacaf98d5675c13The significance of lipids at early stages of marine fish: a review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1d93a98afaf86bfbff48789e9489e851Relationship between essential fatty acid requirements of aquatic animals and the capacity for bioconversion of linolenic acid to highly unsaturated fatty ... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=282acae155e0c7fae24780156fdf2cdbEffects of variation in essential fatty acids in fish feeds on nutritive value of freshwater fish for humans http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ca3432b67c1988532e37559b681f1566Fatty acid requirements in ontogeny of marine and freshwater fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=21f12f1a31c909856591a883aad404c4Requirement criteria for essential fatty acids. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1fa6ddd48b6118a23447917b1a7ea6fbRiboflavin requirements in carp and rainbow trout. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=43f4b44fded72ea3d6039259e6caed9cExploring the nutritional demand for essential fatty acids by aquaculture species http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=18b59b53eb7d2e3a845809a2ce2339d2References:
