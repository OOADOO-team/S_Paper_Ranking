name: Electromyographic Analysis of Core Trunk, Hip, and Thigh Muscles During 9 Rehabilitation Exercisesurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM18560185public_in: 万方authors: Ekstrom, Richard A., Donatelli, Robert A., Carp, Kenji C.,abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, single-group, repeated-measures design. OBJECTIVE: To identify exercises that could be used for strength development and the exercises that would be more appropriate for endurance or stabilization training. BACKGROUND: The exercises analyzed are often used in rehabilitation programs for the spine, hip, and knee, They are active exercises using body weight for resistance; thus a clinician is unable to determine the amount of resistance being applied to a muscle group. Electromyographic (EMG) analysis can provide a measure of muscle activation so that the clinician can have a better idea about the effect the exercise may have on the muscle for strength, endurance, or stabilization. METHODS AND MEASURES: Surface EMG analysis was carried out in 19 males and 11 females while performing the following 9 exercises: active hip abduction, bridge, unilateral-bridge, side-bridge, prone-bridge on elbows and toes, quadruped arm/lower extremity lift, lateral step-up, standing lunge, and using the Dynamic Edge. The rectus abdominis, external oblique abdominis, longissimus thoracis, lumbar multifidus, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, vastus medialis obliquus, and hamstring muscles were studied. RESULTS: In healthy subjects, the lateral step-up and the lunge exercises produced EMG levels greater than 45% maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) in the vastus medialis obliquus, which suggests that they may be beneficial for strengthening that muscle. The side-bridge exercise could be used for strengthening the gluteus medius and the external oblique abdominis muscles, and the quadruped arm/lower extremity lift exercise may help strengthen the gluteus maximus muscle. All the other exercises produced EMG levels less than 45% MVIC, so they may be more beneficial for training endurance or stabilization in healthy subjects. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that these exercises could be used for a core rehabilitation or performance enhancement program. Depending on the individual needs of a patient or athlete, some of the exercises may be more beneficial than others for achieving strength.citations_number: 227Citation: Comparison of Traditional Inverters and $Z$ -Source Inverter for Fuel Cell Vehicles http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7b5404fcbba56877b488fe42f6636dd5Design and Development of a 50kW Z-Source Inverter for Fuel Cell Vehicles http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=67d6025703540ef5ef6f0c2dae5fff0dCore muscle activation during Swiss ball and traditional abdominal exercises http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3700f1fe1c2c6c3fa3824f1610992d73A proximal strengthening program improves pain, function, and biomechanics in women with patellofemoral pain syndrome. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=14a6a66151ea5cb286869a609bf98393Electromyographical analysis of selected lower extremity muscles during 5 unilateral weight-bearing exercises. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e433c71f89963a506496f6a9a0a45c2aHip-muscle activation during the lunge, single-leg squat, and step-up-and-over exercises. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=47b67032df61e2a511aed04df072e8c6Electromyographic analysis of the gluteus medius in five weight-bearing exercises. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e897329af6dfd6b2647dd55484866e40Active video game play in children with cerebral palsy: potential for physical activity promotion and rehabilitation therapies. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fac82571ff8ed332d1c54074c8fc6d52Bilateral comparison of propulsion mechanics during single-leg vertical jumping. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dc7e0492e0dcac589d6efefcb7d1bd45Trunk muscle activation during stabilization exercises with single and double leg support http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d4a99b0683ca4f34338bd1b522185fd3References: Physical measurements as risk indicators for low-back trouble over a one-year period. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fb866251031349f76a7d345fb28c36bdThe relationship of knee and ankle weakness to falls in nursing home residents: an isokinetic study. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=567c0f04fc3fcc24d6d47e7f40b89f02Muscular coactivation.
