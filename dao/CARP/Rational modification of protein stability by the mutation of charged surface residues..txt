name: Rational modification of protein stability by the mutation of charged surface residues.url: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_JJ023417209public_in: 万方authors: S Spector,M Wang,S A Carp,abstract: Abstract Continuum methods were used to calculate the electrostatic contributions of charged and polar side chains to the overall stability of a small 41-residue helical protein, the peripheral subunit-binding domain. The results of these calculations suggest several residues that are destabilizing, relative to hydrophobic isosteres. One position was chosen to test the results of these calculations. Arg8 is located on the surface of the protein in a region of positive electrostatic potential. The calculations suggest that Arg8 makes a significant, unfavorable electrostatic contribution to the overall stability. The experiments described in this paper represent the first direct experimental test of the theoretical methods, taking advantage of solid-phase peptide synthesis to incorporate approximately isosteric amino acid substitutions. Arg8 was replaced with norleucine (Nle), an amino acid that is hydrophobic and approximately isosteric, or with alpha-amino adipic acid (Aad), which is also approximately isosteric but oppositely charged. In this manner, it is possible to isolate electrostatic interactions from the effects of hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions. Both Arg8Nle and Arg8Aad are more thermostable than the wild-type sequence, testifying to the validity of the calculations. These replacements led to stability increases at 52.6 degrees C, the T(m) of the wild-type, of 0.86 and 1.08 kcal mol(-)(1), respectively. The stability of Arg8Nle is particularly interesting as a rare case in which replacement of a surface charge with a hydrophobic residue leads to an increase in the stability of the protein.citations_number: 201Citation: Conditional deletion of Gata3 shows its essential function in T(H)1-T(H)2 responses http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4a4029a3417c10d360761de8941fb90bHow do thermophilic proteins deal with heat? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7af9b85e4fbfece210568353db3d3d01Two exposed amino acid residues confer thermostability on a cold shock protein. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6d61404d5813e56cded16e3c0b3408aaEngineering proteins for thermostability: the use of sequence alignments versus rational design and directed evolution http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cc55ae12fec3ac4f5999a385878639e3Assessing intrarater, interrater and test-retest reliability of continuous measurements http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3c44821105c0a8b1b6eb44fe929cf246Elucidation of Factors Responsible for Enhanced Thermal Stability of Proteins:\u2009 A Structural Genomics Based Study\u2020 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3d062e1e0466097f3c0d6ca268b30ad3Contribution of surface salt bridges to protein stability: guidelines for protein engineering http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9e6a528f09f343ef8397d4d5efcd9674Protein Stability and Surface Electrostatics:\u2009 A Charged Relationship\u2020 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8fbc153c95b4e0c453a066b7ad64a7fdCharge-Charge Interactions Influence the Denatured State Ensemble and Contribute to Protein Stability http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f10e2d932c4493e643ec418d8c7f8a67Unique amino acid composition of proteins in halophilic bacteria. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=beac75408f668ef48a0f9e5641a6ba7cReferences: Prediction of the secondary Structure of Proteins from their Amino Acid Sequence [sic http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b1757059e287551a26ff5fe7a4d3abe61H, 13C and 15N random coil NMR chemical shifts of the common amino acids.
