name: Carp Muscle Calcium-binding Proteinurl: http://www.jbc.org/content/248/9/3327.shortpublic_in: JBCauthors: Robert H. Kretsinger,Clive E. Nockolds,abstract: The structure of crystalline carp muscle calcium-binding protein (parvalbumin) has been determined by x-ray diffraction techniques to nominal 1.85-A resolution. Isomorphous and anomalous scattering data were measured for three heavy atom derivatives, 3-chloromercuri-2-methoxypropyl urea, mercury bromide, and ethyl mercury chloride, to 2.0-A resolution using precession photography. As described in Paper III in this series the 2.0-A phases were refined and the 2.0- to 1.85-A phases were determined by use of the tangent formula.citations_number: 1023Citation: Calmodulin Plays a Pivotal Role in Cellular Regulation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=124898f7b7b92eb0fc45aaa2f79f4edaThe anatomy and taxonomy of protein structure. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c8c2be55eca3aef6750799beea132daaThe S100 protein family: history, function, and expression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d87e40030bcb2b90c822176de96844dStructure of calmodulin refined at 2.2 A resolution http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ca4f95523e917095090d1ca60ef9fc2eBeta-turns in proteins. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2bfe90785b37ed75ca4672e0f2d8490fMolecular evolution of the reactive oxygen-generating NADPH oxidase (Nox\/Duox) family of enzymes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9b5436de769d66962765c5c074559f31X-ray structure of calcineurin inhibited by the immunophilin-immunosuppressant FKBP12-FK506 complex http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f642ead63922e35f77beadb034a30816Calcium binding and conformational response in EF-hand proteins http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6ec09d6320085a93a4f2c3cd70f3a6bbCalmodulin http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7060dccf187cf1134a6daed8024a4604Structure of the calcium regulatory muscle protein troponin-C at 2.8 \u00c5 resolution http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6fffb883c51bdda51865735db99df350References:
