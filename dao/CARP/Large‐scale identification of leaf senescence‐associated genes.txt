name: Large‐scale identification of leaf senescence‐associated genesurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM14617064public_in: 万方authors: Shimon Gepstein,Gazalah Sabehi,Marie‐Jeanne Carp,abstract: &lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leaf senescence is a form of programmed cell death, and is believed to involve preferential expression of a specific set of ‘senescence‐associated genes’ (SAGs). To decipher the molecular mechanisms and the predicted complex network of regulatory pathways involved in the senescence program, we have carried out a large‐scale gene identification study in a reference plant, Arabidopsis thaliana . Using suppression subtractive hybridization, we isolated approximately 800 cDNA clones representing SAGs expressed in senescing leaves. Differential expression was confirmed by Northern blot analysis for 130 non‐redundant genes. Over 70 of the identified genes have not previously been shown to participate in the senescence process. SAG‐encoded proteins are likely to participate in macromolecule degradation, detoxification of oxidative metabolites, induction of defense mechanisms, and signaling and regulatory events. Temporal expression profiles of selected genes displayed several distinct patterns, from expression at a very early stage, to the terminal phase of the senescence syndrome. Expression of some of the novel SAGs, in response to age, leaf detachment, darkness, and ethylene and cytokinin treatment was compared. The large repertoire of SAGs identified here provides global insights about regulatory, biochemical and cellular events occurring during leaf senescence.&lt;/p&gt;citations_number: 338Citation: Comparative transcriptome analysis reveals significant differences in gene expression and signalling pathways between developmental and dark\/starvation-ind... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9bd29681fde9784c6c8767c1da760e0dThe potassium-dependent transcriptome of Arabidopsis reveals a prominent role of jasmonic acid in nutrient signaling http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4cd43f767641b5e22da23a4f2734f084AtNAP, a NAC family transcription factor, has an important role in leaf senescence http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d087e0b87ed71e1e588b34276438c5ecPhosphorus dynamics: from soil to plant. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dc388800c6f116a83504da47fd08348dA gene regulatory network controlled by the NAC transcription factor ANAC092\/AtNAC2\/ORE1 during salt-promoted senescence http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5c88e4815358273b83552498fe7139c7Leaf Senescence - Annual Review of Plant Biology, 58(1):115 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a25e43a064c1c539d7da2b9246fdbb58Molecular events in senescing Arabidopsis leaves http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9589304de3ffd63c36c2632fa8a77308Opportunities for improving phosphorus-use efficiency in crop plants. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=82da025b7191db3eb91e79ef62320c4bSenescence-associated vacuoles with intense proteolytic activity develop in leaves of Arabidopsis and soybean http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c29d8cc03beb739c734fdffb2cd4f812Steam-girdling of barly (Hordeum vulgare) leaves leads to carbohydrate accumulation and accelerated leaf senescence, facilitating transcriptomic analysis o... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2fdb2d7513d5d4a17b45ead6bfc71a70References: Inhibition of Leaf Senescence by Autoregulated Production of Cytokinin http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8941bb2226739734d6e2ad8f3a3206ebThe molecular biology of leaf senescence http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=88b97c8b207c7edc13e388fbca898af5Making Sense of Senescence: Molecular Genetic Regulation and Manipulation of Leaf Senescence http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3a3cd0d2129b8082433ff3e4b6c1484aSuppression subtractive hybridization: a versatile method for identifying differentially expressed genes. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f43ae9481d6978c7d62d910dbc9a69aaTargets of AtWRKY6 regulation during plant senescence and pathogen defense. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ff3c5cce1b0747a0b1bb1c477ac3634dThe APG8\/12-activating Enzyme APG7 Is Required for Proper Nutrient Recycling and Senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=78381815c8d02e1093a76f87e6bb3534Molecular aspects of leaf senescence. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0a9b0d35b8bef65cfc953e75fb1bfe26Molecular Aspect of Leaf Senescence http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=86c2c83d6303a9deb8b5f3fce94cddd3A comparison of the expression patterns of several senescence-associated genes in response to stress and hormone treatment.
