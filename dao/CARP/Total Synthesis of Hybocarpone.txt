name: Total Synthesis of Hybocarponeurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/230127275_Total_Synthesis_of_Hybocarponepublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: K. C. Nicolaou,David Gray,abstract: A general technique of preparing labeled alkenes is described and demonstrated with the pyrolysis of (C 6 H 5 ) 2 P(0)0 14 CH 2 - 14 CH 2 CN to give 14 CH 2 = 14 CHCN. This Method permits the rapid preparation of labeled acrylonitrile as needed on a wide scale range. The process is illustrated in the synthesis of the title azasteroids.citations_number: 286Citation: Cascade Reactions in Total Synthesis: Recent Advances http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d38b795b4187c70da652845961ce9843HIO 3 and I 2 O 5 : Mild and selective alternative reagents to IBX for the dehydrogenation of aldehydes and ketones http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fa608fc1b0c04dc3a0a7a20ee90b3427Tandem reactions, cascade sequences, and biomimetic strategies in total synthesis. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4dde3f8d1749aa96e0031058ad2d4272Glycan-based interactions involving vertebrate sialic-acid-recognizing proteins. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=446b5e3298576ad287ee6bf2d82e6473The CP molecule labyrinth: a paradigm of how endeavors in total synthesis lead to discoveries and inventions in organic synthesis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=59924740ac0916b68e980f93fdb22a00Sweet spots in functional glycomics. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=efe44bc7cd101ff203beabd910c708c3Iodine(V) reagents in organic synthesis.
