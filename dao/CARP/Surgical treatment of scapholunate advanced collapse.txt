Scaphoid excision and intercarpal arthrodesis was performed in 31 cases: four-corner arthrodesis in 23 cases and capitolunate arthrodesis in 8 cases. Proximal row carpectomy was performed in 12 cases, radioscapholunate arthrodesis in 5 cases, radioscaphoid arthrodesis in 3 cases, and primary total wrist arthrodesis in 4 cases. Following surgical treatment the majority of patients in all groups had less wrist pain. The nonunion rate was four cases for the capitolunate arthrodesis group compared with two for the four-corner arthrodesis group. Six of 51 motion-sparing cases were converted to total arthrodeses. Scaphoid excision and four-corner arthrodesis reliably diminished wrist pain in patients with stage III SLAC wrist while maintaining a 54 degrees flexion-extension arc. Stage II SLAC wrist can be successfully treated with this procedure, radioscaphoid arthrodesis, or proximal row carpectomy. Of the three procedures, proximal row carpectomy best preserves wrist mobility, with a flexion-extension arc of 71 degrees.citations_number: 343Citation: Biphasic calcium phosphate bioceramics: preparation, properties and applications. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=192302570fed22ca2b41970aac1bd53eHerbert screw fixation of scaphoid fractures. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f3f2b3161348de096843f5bdf084fcb3Degenerative arthritis of the wrist: proximal row carpectomy versus scaphoid excision and four-corner arthrodesis. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d97103d082e4f513ddeeee1b959d8335In vivo scaphoid, lunate, and capitate kinematics in flexion and in extension. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b7819c3f8d2055cf8467166df5f10ce7Percutaneous screw fixation versus conservative treatment for fractures of the waist of the scaphoid: A PROSPECTIVE RANDOMISED STUDY http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0dfae490f45d0ec9c6deef4b95c15c2fIsolated tears of the triangular fibrocartilage: Management by early arthroscopic repair \u2020 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a62f07f7aff3c4d405cac839ab62d2e2The cutaneous innervation of the female breast and nipple-areola complex: implications for surgery http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7201b5ec17b94cd3a7ec8c9151908ae8Scapholunate instability: current concepts in diagnosis and management. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=73383256608c49ef86883d1ad8081370Ulnar shortening for triangular fibrocartilage complex tears associated with ulnar positive variance. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=66bd5af70bba756aae9bf407326c6e86Arthroscopically assisted reduction of intra-articular fractures of the distal radius http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f6a1110d30c4dce7b9078b37e37ff1b8References: The SLAC wrist: scapholunate advanced collapse pattern of degenerative arthritis. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1b8cab9a7b5afddd2e1b5a8e46e4070dFunctional wrist motion: a biomechanical study. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8bb4eaee0951536acb032309f7968c8fFunctional ranges of motion of the wrist joint http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=399d99172cfeae0f30b42ee4917cf0c6Degenerative change in symptomatic scaphoid nonunion http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6404a2e5091892760163bed63e2f95b8Limited wrist arthrodesis.
