name: Riboflavin requirements in carp and rainbow trouturl: http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/19811420184.htmlpublic_in: CAB Directauthors: L. Takeuchi,T. Takeuchi,C. Ogino,abstract: The requirements and signs of deficiency of riboflavin and the availability of riboflavin tetrabutyrate were studied with the carp, Cyprinus carpio, and the rainbow trout, Salmo gairdneri. Intestinal homogenate of rainbow trout hydrolysed riboflavin tetrabutyrate and liberated riboflavin from the ester. Feeding experiments also showed that the riboflavin ester was available like free riboflavin...citations_number: 255Citation: The lipid composition and biochemistry of freshwater fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=38b3bb1371f693a57d1a9a4e5a0c45c6Nutritional values of live organisms used in Japan for mass propagation of fish: A review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ed5e5e6c285a15688dcc04082accd014Amino acid requirements for growth of Nile tilapia. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=23151b0e12681dc6fef0badbe70ae74bEffects of purified diets containing different combinations of arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acid on survival, growth and fatty acid composition of juven... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=64bdd297c6fd01dfa1abee31a334a6c6Fatty acid requirements in ontogeny of marine and freshwater fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=21f12f1a31c909856591a883aad404c4Aspects of intermediary metabolism in salmonid fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bdb315874fb1b528f71bd7bdcfc49f24Requirement criteria for essential fatty acids. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1fa6ddd48b6118a23447917b1a7ea6fbResponse of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) growing from 50 to 170 g to supplements of either L-arginine or L-threonine in a semipurified diet. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=030e2c3fda547fc280d20ac2f86f4188Lysine requirement of junvenile Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus and juvenile red sea bream Pagrus major. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3707fa71f6d78babad3ecb937be2621cRelationship of whole body and egg essential amino acid patterns to amino acid requirement patterns in channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatus \u2606 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1f098270e751e14f4b5bf765bc3530c0References: Effects of \u03b1-tocopherol deficiency on carp. 2.
