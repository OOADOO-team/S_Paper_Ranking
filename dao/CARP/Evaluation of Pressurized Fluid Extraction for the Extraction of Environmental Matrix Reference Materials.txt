name: Evaluation of Pressurized Fluid Extraction for the Extraction of Environmental Matrix Reference Materialsurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/231206251_Evaluation_of_Pressurized_Fluid_Extraction_for_the_Extraction_of_Environmental_Matrix_Reference_Materialspublic_in: ResearchGateauthors: Schantz, Michele M., Nichols, John J., Wise, Stephen A.,abstract: Pressurized fluid extraction (PFE) has been evaluated for the extraction of selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners, and chlorinated pesticides from the following reference materials: SRM 1649a (Urban Dust/Organics), SRM 1650 (Diesel Particulate Matter), SRM 2975 (Diesel Particulate Matter, Industrial Forklift), SRM 1941a (Organics in Marine Sediment), SRM 1944 (New York/New Jersey Waterway Sediment), SRM 2974 (Organics in Freeze-Dried Mussel Tissue), CARP-1 (Ground Whole Carp), and CARP-2 (Ground Whole Carp). Several solvent systems were evaluated for each reference material. PFE showed extraction efficiency comparable to that of Soxhlet extraction for the selected PAHs, PCB congeners, and chlorinated pesticides quantified in the air particulate, sediment, mussel tissue, and fish materials and greater extraction efficiencies for the higher molecular weight PAHs in the diesel particulate materials.citations_number: 228Citation: Before the injection\u2014modern
