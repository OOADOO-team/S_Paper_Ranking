name: Complications of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion using recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2url: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM17387522public_in: 万方authors: Rahul Vaidya, Julia Carp, Anil Sethi,abstract: The use of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) in spinal fusion has increased dramatically since an FDA approval for its use in anterior lumbar fusion with the LT cage. There are several reports of its use in transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion, posterolateral fusion, and anterior cervical fusion. Reports on adverse effects of rhBMP-2 when used in spinal fusion are scarce in literature. An Institutional Review Board approved retrospective study was conducted in patients undergoing anterior spinal fusion and instrumentation following diskectomy at a single center. Forty-six consecutive patients were included. Twenty-two patients treated with rhBMP-2 and PEEK cages were compared to 24 in whom allograft spacers and demineralized bone matrix was used. Patients filled out Cervical Oswestry Scores, VAS for arm pain, neck pain, and had radiographs preoperatively as well at every follow up visit. Radiographic examination following surgery revealed end plate resorption in all patients in whom rhBMP-2 was used. This was followed by a period of new bone formation commencing at 6 weeks. In contrast, allograft patients showed a progressive blurring of end plate-allograft junction. Dysphagia was a common complication and it was significantly more frequent and more severe in patients in whom rhBMP-2 was used. Post operative swelling anterior to the vertebral body on lateral cervical spine X-ray was significantly larger in the rhBMP-2 group when measured from 1 to 6 weeks after which it was similar. These effects are possibly due to an early inflammatory response to rhBMP-2 and were observed to be dose related. With the parameters we used, there was no significant difference in the clinical outcome of patients in the two groups at 2 years. The cost of implants in patients treated with rhBMP-2 and PEEK spacers was more than three times the cost of allograft spacers and demineralized bone matrix in 1, 2, and 3-level cases. Despite providing consistently good fusion rates, we have abandoned using rhBMP-2 and PEEK cages for anterior cervical fusion, due to the side effects, high cost, and the availability of a suitable alternative.citations_number: 180Citation: Prevalence, complications, and hospital charges associated with use of bone-morphogenetic proteins in spinal fusion procedures. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0ce1a3b0727653439224f2b82afde914Cell-Based Bone Tissue Engineering http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b08b3f1019103034a56df13c833bafa6Complications associated with single-level transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=90d72fa65abb07b708a5dd83621b3dc0Adverse swelling associated with use of rh-BMP-2 in anterior cervical discectomy and fusion: a case study http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=192ad7713e421a1a456fcaf4f6d0b14fComplications related to osteobiologics use in spine surgery: A systematic review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f823670d677cfe68b2ebd96335ac9a64The effects of competition and predation on diversification in a model adaptive radiation. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5cff402567880bbb5088b148815cb9a6Effectiveness and harms of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 in spine fusion: a systematic review and meta-analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=609b8d7bd0b5ac654c951691204a48c8Interbody fusion with allograft and rhBMP-2 leads to consistent fusion but early subsidence. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2ac367f2252c9f835f7fdd4764f6cf0dSafety and Effectiveness of Recombinant Human Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 for Spinal Fusion: A Meta-analysis of Individual-Participant Data http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=63586a4b9fa0a82fd6df044b9f338542Complications in the use of rhBMP-2 in PEEK cages for interbody spinal fusions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=25d9c617b68a27680bc953b03c5e2fa0References: Bone: formation by autoinduction. 1965. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=53a776584e6a2b862a958e49b49e9f2bThe MOS 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36): III.
