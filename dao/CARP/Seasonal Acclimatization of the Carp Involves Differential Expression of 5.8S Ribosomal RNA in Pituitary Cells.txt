name: Seasonal Acclimatization of the Carp Involves Differential Expression of 5.8S Ribosomal RNA in Pituitary Cellsurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030504919700271Xpublic_in: Elsevierauthors: Marı́a Inés Vera,Hernán M Rı́os,Erwin de la Fuente,abstract: In the carp, nucleolar reorganization is one of the most remarkable features of the cellular adjustment that occurs upon seasonal acclimatization. To assess if the level of cellular expression of a specific rRNA is maintained between both seasonal adaptive states, we isolated a carp 5.8S rRNA gene. Sequence analyses showed its high conservation during evolution. The level of expression of 5.8S rRNA was determined by in situ  hybridization assays in pituitary sections from summer- and winter-acclimatized carp. The quantification of the positive hybridization signals demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the acclimatization states. Transcription of 5.8S rRNA was considerably higher in summer- than in winter-acclimatized carp. These results indicate that the level of rRNA expression in eurythermal fish is not comparable between seasons and suggest that rRNA genes may be not constitutive. Thus, rRNA transcription should be used with caution as a reference to quantitate transcripts that are modulated as part of the acclimatization process in eurythermal fish.citations_number: 49Citation: Medical Consequences of Antibiotic Use in Agriculture http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e2cc1e6df3198924b77c18997e7c123bNontyphoidal Salmonellosis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f27caef2a0aa049d7edbbc727bb4f15dPhylogenetic analysis of the cadherin superfamily allows identification of six major subfamilies besides several solitary members. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a9017a6102130d65874f15d7c09945b1Emergence of multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium DT104 infections in the United States. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a7120564c0284a74d296bc6eede4741aA molecular timescale of eukaryote evolution and the rise of complex multicellular life http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9cd9f2333ff4390e735856bd5c531875Mobile gene cassettes and integrons: capture and spread of genes by site\u2010specific recombination http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ffe733c5ca08024b55472ff32f5b75daAn outbreak of multidrug-resistant, quinolone-resistant Salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium DT104. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=48d62135d3badafddbc87bd389688ea4The Isolation of Antibiotic-Resistant Salmonella from Retail Ground Meats http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=be4ed4d36088f3ed8fc5dc9967a236a5Recent improvements to the PROSITE database http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b058073f44dff2433737c2b3892eb2b5Xa21D Encodes a Receptor-Like Molecule with a Leucine-Rich Repeat Domain That Determines Race-Specific Recognition and Is Subject to Adaptive Evolution http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ce0c4fcf2cb8ce3779b259fd16e8fdd5References: An improvement of the single-step method of RNA isolation by acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fb4de80fa7659e8036611005c977449cA Review of Human Salmonellosis: III.
