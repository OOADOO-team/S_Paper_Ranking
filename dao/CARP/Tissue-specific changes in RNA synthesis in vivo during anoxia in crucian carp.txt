Smith,Dominic F. Houlihan,Göran E. Nilsson,abstract: Abstract Mechanisms of anoxia tolerance were investigated in crucian carp. Rates of protein synthesis were calculated in selected tissues of normoxic and anoxic animals. Exposure to 48 h of anoxia resulted in a significant reduction in protein synthesis in the liver (&gt; 95%), heart (53%), and red and white muscle (52 and 56%, respectively), whereas brain protein synthesis rates were unaffected. Seven days of anoxia produced similar results. After 24 h of recovery from a 48-h anoxic period, protein synthesis rates had virtually returned to normoxic values. The effect of anoxia on the amount of RNA (relative to protein) varied depending on the tissue and also the length of exposure (except in the brain, where it was consistently reduced). However, the effect on RNA translational efficiency was purely tissue specific (i.e., independent of exposure time) and was unaffected in the heart, reduced in the liver and red and white muscle, and increased in the brain. Downregulation of protein synthesis on a tissue-specific basis appears to be a significant mechanism for energy conservation as well as maintaining neural function, thus promoting survival during anoxia.citations_number: 132Citation: Metabolism and Functions of Lipids and Fatty Acids in Teleost Fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d3d049c4c92732390d972ffb4ceefcaeHIF-1 is expressed in normoxic tissue and displays an organ-specific regulation under systemic hypoxia http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8ad19f53151143904af5ad6a14323f20A novel hypoxia-inducible factor-independent hypoxic response regulating mammalian target of rapamycin and its targets. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bd0ce98c53009cbe5e87296160f2ccd5A highly unsaturated fatty acid predicts carbon transfer between primary producers and consumers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e70f9f75dcd4cb1a93d1f62a6d59d918Metabolic depression in animals: physiological perspectives and biochemical generalizations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dd76a42b03016fa79448832fe4702aa6Hypoxia-induced gene expression profiling in the euryoxic fish Gillichthys mirabilis. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d84fc74db2a82ff3e3737dab63de5fe8Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase leads to the phosphorylation of elongation factor 2 and an inhibition of protein synthesis. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e2aecd71efa639f8a5bc2a8385977705Mitochondrial Ion Channels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=937b3cb07b6cc1a09af9edea70541320Metabolic rate depression in animals: transcriptional and translational controls http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0ffbb3f73c134b68ed2efcb0e5001201Oxygen-dependent gene expression in fishes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7f835f1276f3498ab6b71e447e950a9aReferences: A rapid and convenient technique for measuring the rate of protein synthesis in tissues by injection of [3H]phenylalanine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3cfd3d424ea4d2641f90f087c95a9611The determination of nucleic acids. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3088ad78627be44995601379920f81d4Nucleoside and nucleobase transport in animal cells http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e9d11dac635e5198d1f6355e695daf4aGrowth Rates and Protein Turnover in Atlantic Cod, Gadus morhua http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=99ac2f012e58288d402956a1a31a82e8Gene expression in acute myocardial stress.
