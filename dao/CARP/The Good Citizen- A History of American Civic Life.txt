name: The Good Citizen: A History of American Civic Lifeurl: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/08821127.2000.10739229public_in: Taylor & Francisauthors: Humphrey, Carol Sue,abstract: In 1996, less than half of all eligible voters bothered to vote. Fewer citizens each year follow government and public affairs regularly. Is popular sovereignty a failure? Not necessarily, argues Michael Schudson in this provocative history of citizenship in America. Schudson sees American politics as evolving from a &quot;politics of assent&quot; in colonial times and the eighteenth century, in which voting generally reaffirmed the social hierarchy of the community; to a &quot;politics of affiliation&quot; in the nineteenth century, in which party loyalty was paramount for &quot;the good citizen.&quot; Progressive reforms around the turn of the century reduced the power of parties and increased the role of education, making way for the &quot;informed citizen,&quot; which remains the ideal in American civic life. Today a fourth model, &quot;the rights-bearing citizen,&quot; supplements the &quot;informed citizen&quot; model and makes the courthouse as well as the voting booth a channel for citizenship.citations_number: 383Citation: Social Implications of the Internet http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ec26b4937ef27542d10ff09e73b8c343What Kind of Citizen?
