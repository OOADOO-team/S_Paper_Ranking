name: Isolation and identification of a radical scavenging antioxidant - Punicalagin from pith and carpellary membrane of pomegranate fruiturl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814604000329public_in: Elsevierauthors: Anand P Kulkarni,Somaradhya Mallikarjuna Aradhya,Soundar Divakar,abstract: Pith and carpellary membrane (CM) constitute 13% of pomegranate fruit composition. Pith acts as an anchoring tissue while CM acts as a protective membrane; both play significant roles in determining the health and disease status of pomegranate arils but remain unexplored for their nutraceutical properties. Activity-guided repeated fractionation of the methanol extract on a silica gel column, followed by preparative HPLC, yielded a compound which exhibited strong radical scavenging activity with EC 50 values of 16.7 ± 2.3 and 54.2 ± 4.6 against DPPH free radical and superoxide radicals, respectively. It also showed a very strong lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity in a liposome model system with an EC 50 value of 54.2 ± 0.9. However, it showed negligible metal chelating activity. Based on UV, IR, 2D-NMR, GC-Mass and MALDI-Mass studies, the compound was identified as punicalagin. The antioxidant activity of punicalagin and the methanol extract can be ascribed mainly to radical scavenging ability.citations_number: 190Citation: In vitro antiproliferative, apoptotic and antioxidant activities of punicalagin, ellagic acid and a total pomegranate tannin extract are enhanced in combin... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d5ef3003328ad705c8339fe8dea7ce0fAntioxidant, antimalarial and antimicrobial activities of tannin-rich fractions, ellagitannins and phenolic acids from Punica granatum L http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=aa46f97d3b50f12d4eb4e7a333d6e321Antioxidant potential of mint (Mentha spicata L.) in radiation-processed lamb meat http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e70d84b50798a5698001cccd81ef37a4Antioxidant activity, polyphenol content, and related compounds in different fruit juices and homogenates prepared from 29 different pomegranate accessions. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6b8b242f837d98dd182610bfe479fb8aPomegranate and its many functional components as related to human health: a review. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f8a4cdd8348484aa654e53d65bc50355Chemical changes and antioxidant activity in pomegranate arils during fruit development http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3019a9b42f0e1273ca07184db58136b7The mechanisms involved in seed dormancy alleviation by hydrogen cyanide unravel the role of reactive oxygen species as key factors of cellular signaling d... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=404d0bee5ac11d4d7de717d49d76ad25Classification of eight pomegranate juices based on antioxidant capacity measured by four methods. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5d3bf58609aa0259458dc85105da7491Identification of phenolic compounds and appraisal of antioxidant and antityrosinase activities from litchi ( Litchi sinensis Sonn.) seeds http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=334160b4285e240e05203cb101a56f3aExtraction modeling and activities of antioxidants from pomegranate marc http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=34a6f6649a7a01cdfa37d08a2062cee5References: High Molecular Weight Plant Polyphenolics (Tannins) as Biological Antioxidants http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7089293111794a188a3ea35d6753cb1eFree radical scavenging activities of mushroom polysaccharide extracts http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=21778ff05dcb3203d30e941d5e78bfd1How to characterize a biological antioxidant. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9ed042636dd89f6944ee0f7ce8b87174Antioxidant activities of caffeic acid and its related hydroxycinnamic acid compounds. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=08a09a7c307127a28c620def5487b55aKinetics and mechanisms of antioxidant activity using the DPPH. free radical method. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ae071f6d09544d111fb5367b1c32e9aaTannins as Biological Antioxidants http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=273c4129cb61442e04625352cd2d112eAntioxidant flavonols and ischemic heart disease in a Welsh population of men: the Caerphilly Study. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=95c4a9ab72fe03d22c368bc498c127ffAntioxidative activity of three herbal water extracts http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=32aa3d24ffa489cc5ad9cb1b4a75d0c0Antioxidant Activity of Caffeic Acid and Dihydrocaffeic Acid in Lard and Human Low-Density Lipoprotein\u2020 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c199b883ebf740b58857b02cd9f00adaTannins as Biological Antioxidants http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=852daa0e38db5a9bd6696109c6df6413
