name: Carp muscle calcium-binding protein. II. Structure determination and general descriptionurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM4700463public_in: 万方authors: KRETSINGER,R. H,abstract: The structure of crystalline carp muscle calcium-binding protein (parvalbumin) has been determined by x-ray diffraction techniques to nominal 1.85-A resolution. Isomorphous and anomalous scattering data were measured for three heavy atom derivatives, 3-chloromercuri-2-methoxypropyl urea, mercury bromide, and ethyl mercury chloride, to 2.0-A resolution using precession photography. As described in Paper III in this series the 2.0-A phases were refined and the 2.0- to 1.85-A phases were determined by use of the tangent formula.citations_number: 1037Citation: Calmodulin Plays a Pivotal Role in Cellular Regulation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=124898f7b7b92eb0fc45aaa2f79f4edaThe anatomy and taxonomy of protein structure. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c8c2be55eca3aef6750799beea132daaThe S100 protein family: history, function, and expression http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d87e40030bcb2b90c822176de96844dStructure of calmodulin refined at 2.2 A resolution http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ca4f95523e917095090d1ca60ef9fc2eThree-dimensional structure of calmodulin http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fb6c25659dcad15838423acacb323539A simplified representation of protein conformations for rapid simulation of protein folding \u2606 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=de89f3224dd4e728a5bc8c1f4c4350acBeta-turns in proteins. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2bfe90785b37ed75ca4672e0f2d8490fMolecular evolution of the reactive oxygen-generating NADPH oxidase (Nox\/Duox) family of enzymes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9b5436de769d66962765c5c074559f31X-ray structure of calcineurin inhibited by the immunophilin-immunosuppressant FKBP12-FK506 complex http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f642ead63922e35f77beadb034a30816S100 proteins in mouse and man: from evolution to function and pathology (including an update of the nomenclature). http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7a4da77d2e989176677387b90074a1bdReferences: FOCUS: FROM MOBILITIES TO PROTEOMES Folding and Unfolding of Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs in the Gas Phase http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9b321762ff12438aab5939a29da8fd98
