name: Assessing impacts of introduced aquatic species: Grass carp in large systemsurl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02394691public_in: Springerauthors: Mark B. Bain,abstract: Introduced species have created environmental benefits and unanticipated disasters so a priori assessments of species introductions are needed for environmental management. A checklist for assessing impacts of introduced species was developed from studies of introduced species and recommendations for planning introductions. Sterile, triploid grass carp ( Ctenopharyngodon idella ) are just beginning to be used as a biocontrol agent for the management of aquatic vegetation in open waterways. Potential impacts of grass carp in open systems were identified by reviewing grass carp biology relative to the impact assessment checklist. The potential consequences of introduced grass carp were reviewed for one case study. The case study demonstrated that conclusions about potential impacts and monitoring needs can be made despite incomplete information and uncertainty.Indicators of environmental impact and vulnerability of host systems were grouped into six categories: population control, hybridization, diseases and parasites, habitat alterations, biological effects, and management issues. Triploid grass carp can significantly alter habitat and biological resources through the secondary effects of reductions in aquatic vegetation. Potential impacts and significant uncertainties involve fish dispersions from plant control areas, inability to control vegetation loss, loss of diverse plant communities and their dependent species, and conflicts with human use of the water resource. Adequate knowledge existed to assess most potential consequences of releasing large numbers of triploid grass carp in Guntersville Reservoir, Alabama. However, the assessment of potential impacts indicated that moderate, incremental stockings combined with monitoring of vegetation and biological resources are necessary to control the effects of grass carp and achieve desirable, intermediate plant densities.citations_number: 238Citation: Classification and Regression Trees: A Powerful Yet Simple Technique for Ecological Data Analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=27b0b1ed895b5dea5b50f4ecc75017aaORGANIC MATTER FLOW IN STREAM FOOD WEBS WITH REDUCED DETRITAL RESOURCE BASE http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=44314aafb3adedb57a5a68dba2d9d4b5The Global Decline of Reptiles, D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu Amphibians http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b5dd727faa8f3b12924115e6f52a980bNonindigenous Species of the Pacific Northwest: An Overlooked Risk to Endangered Salmon? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=87a6b2851d39e168752097b1064a6ef8APPLICATION OF ECOLOGICAL CRITERIA IN SELECTING MARINE RESERVES AND DEVELOPING RESERVE NETWORKS http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c7f823155da1e0c4211f7301f245ecd8Phylogeny of Trichoptera (Caddisflies): Characterization of Signal and Noise within Multiple Datasets http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1d7ad1da3d8aee7d65e0b2bf055b9065The invasion paradox: reconciling pattern and process in species invasions. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9ba99f83d049a07595fd78ed346d5b75Possible climate-induced shift of stoneflies in a southern Appalachian catchment http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=817319ff06ca38b6c6575d6e72f9e0c2Freshwater biodiversity conservation: recent progress and future challenges http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e8380507e30419500420a35a3c5b0efeOverfishing of Inland Waters http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cc61f213c146102ba3b00b0776e954d7References: The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d695adcf31cf7a07aedc10d74ac80b93Pacific Salmon at the Crossroads: Stocks at Risk from California, Oregon, Idaho, and Washington http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4efe4c22136ce439152bd9675625ee02A Sand County Almanac http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ed075067ce318387e66e8fdb3c83d021Top-Down and Bottom-Up Forces in Food Webs: Do Plants Have Primacy http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=279bca48d407af7b2dd7d92565ceb88dThe plant vigor hypothesis and herbivore attack http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b3aafa5b5c01595cea24d3d22f02997eBiodiversity Conservation in Running Waters http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d8b36fc53203c0bcd71ee74843411bcaPacific salmon life histories. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a76fe15ba3490157942513b67c3f5b13River Fisheries.
