name: Composition, Diversity, and Origin of the Bacterial Community in Grass Carp Intestineurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM22363439public_in: 万方authors: Shangong Wu,Guitang Wang,Esther R. Angert,abstract: Gut microbiota has become an integral component of the host, and received increasing attention. However, for many domestic animals, information on the microbiota is insufficient and more effort should be exerted to manage the gastrointestinal bacterial community. Understanding the factors that influence the composition of microbial community in the host alimentary canal is essential to manage or improve the microbial community composition. In the present study, 16S rRNA gene sequence-based comparisons of the bacterial communities in the grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) intestinal contents and fish culture-associated environments are performed. The results show that the fish intestinal microbiota harbors many cellulose-decomposing bacteria, including sequences related to Anoxybacillus, Leuconostoc, Clostridium, Actinomyces, and Citrobacter. The most abundant bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the grass carp intestinal content are those related to feed digestion. In addition, the potential pathogens and probiotics are important members of the intestinal microbiota. Further analyses show that grass carp intestine holds a core microbiota composed of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. The comparison analyses reveal that the bacterial community in the intestinal contents is most similar to those from the culture water and sediment. However, feed also plays significant influence on the composition of gut microbiota.citations_number: 163Citation: Teleost microbiomes: the state of the art in their characterization, manipulation and importance in aquaculture and fisheries. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3508acd0306acffe22c7faa01b4e7ba9Fish gut microbiota analysis differentiates physiology and behavior of invasive Asian carp and indigenous American fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=89e01eb65fca66fcc16fe28eb2b25da6Intestinal microbiota in fishes: what's known and what's not http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=47864639936bd76e689d1e8da4e6cd46Analysis of Stomach and Gut Microbiomes of the Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) from Coastal Louisiana, USA http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c2e5a8c280d43ca9c19b35ba7c683fdaThe intestinal microbiome of fish under starvation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=13289cfd9c84a7056421a8add855b855Probiotics in fish and shellfish culture: immunomodulatory and ecophysiological responses http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2fce7cacf7ed7a1b4ca84f9cdaba23edTaxonomic and functional metagenomic profiling of gastrointestinal tract microbiome of the farmed adult turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a85383341c31d84f1a47f61751bf32b3Recent discoveries and applications of Anoxybacillus http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b598dff709533ce48bc31420b730898cA new view of the fish gut microbiome: Advances from next-generation sequencing http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=18d608306ff1801a6b3e05fafd38ec9eComparative Analysis of the Intestinal Bacterial Communities in Different Species of Carp by Pyrosequencing. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5db6df1e4fb7b6e081027aa379e83ca1References: Worlds within worlds: Evolution of the vertebrate gut microbiota http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bef5594fd56d87ec585cc673229241e5Comparative analysis of human gut microbiota by barcoded pyrosequencing. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0648ccee9945388884fa243acf9008b0The role of probiotics in aquaculture. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cc0c02f58bcfc15ccb0758170dfe1949Polysaccharide utilization by gut bacteria: potential for new insights from genomic analysis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=11c8b17b30bf0ebfe9aa5876c9d7e0c0Composition, variability, and temporal stability of the intestinal microbiota of the elderly http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d33bc7e4a20e74426b82fb8e9c7116d5Genomic and Metabolic Studies of the Impact of Probiotics on a Model Gut Symbiont and Host http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1577caa0b52c1f2efba6a7281fdcdc82Improved extraction of PCR-quality community DNA from digesta and fecal samples. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9bd0619f6b387de3f7217eb3e3246e50Lactic acid bacteria in fish: a review. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0fa1bd9bb08beb7c9dff92c950a73029Gnotobiotic Zebrafish Reveal Evolutionarily Conserved Responses to the Gut Microbiota http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=107eba8489538c27fb11bc7997d9769aHonor thy symbionts http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ce4212bed9a2232ba441df4ab4a22a0bGenomics of Actinobacteria: tracing the evolutionary history of an ancient phylum. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d36e45b36290ed6be64899170e96ae43Bacterial flora of fishes: A review. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=60ce374f5f19113259afba60238e5af1INAUGURAL ARTICLE by a Recently Elected Academy Member:Honor thy symbionts http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=829f771918eb88853284dd8a4155b2abAnalysis of 16S libraries of mouse gastrointestinal microflora reveals a large new group of mouse intestinal bacteria. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=521b449881bb2f72cc87fc120612230aEvidence for a core gut microbiota in the zebrafish.
