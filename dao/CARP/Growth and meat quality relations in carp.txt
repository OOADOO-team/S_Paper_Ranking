name: Growth and meat quality relations in carpurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004484869400309Cpublic_in: Elsevierauthors: Benoit Fauconneau,Hélène Alami-Durante,Michel Laroche,abstract: Growth proceeds through an harmonious development of major tissues, namely bone, muscle and adipose tissues. Changes in chemical composition result from differential growth of these tissues. Little is known about the relative changes in morphometric traits during development of carp or about their genetic basis, but it seems that valuable criteria for selection on suitability for processing could be found in the mechanisms of bone and muscle development. The development of fatty tissues associated with growth of carp is stimulated by the use of lipid-enriched or high-energy artificial diets. Fat is accumulated in specific adipose tissues and the analysis of the relative development of these tissues could give valuable information on the over-accumulation of fat and its distribution in the whole body. Accumulation of fat has either positive or negative consequences for sensory evaluation depending on the source and the composition of fat. The main characteristics of muscle and connective tissues are presented in this paper. Different muscle tissues comprising different fibre types are found in cyprinids. These tissues together with adipose tissues compose the edible part of carp and explain most of protein retention. Protein content and composition are stable during development. Furthermore, a wide variability in the characteristics of muscle and connective tissues persists in commercial-size fish related to their mode of development. It is especially true for the main contractile protein: myosin. This is illustrated on expression of isoform of myosin but in early stages. The changes in the characteristics of the tissues and of the flesh after death and during postmortem storage and processing are reviewed. The structural components and the organization of tissues are very specific in fish and more sensitive to destruction. Thus, the degradative processes that affect the flesh during storage and processing have important consequences for sensory evaluation of the flesh which in freshwater species is generally rather soft and with neutral odour and taste. In this paper the possible role of biological characteristics of the flesh and of its constitutive tissues in quality is analyzed for the effect of body weight and for the effect of acclimation temperature. Temperature induces specific compensation for the maintenance of basic processes and the consequences for quality are analysed as wellcitations_number: 228Citation: Muscle development and growth: potential implications for flesh quality in fish. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b48abf268b9c94fc8a1af04990b7389bCompositional and organoleptic quality of farmed and wild gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) and sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and factors affecting it: ... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c4f423e4e947b12feab623cf715824f7Muscle fibre density in relation to the colour and texture of smoked Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar L.) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=83d7c86add48ebc6d4ef6b459f2a9413Feeding behaviour and food utilisation in tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus: effect of sex ratio and relationship with the endocrine status http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e7b6dba42253ebd1213d2fa427a2b8e8Structural and ultrastructural changes on muscle tissue of sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax L., after cooking and freezing http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3a7489698a1baf7022eddae1ae45ce74\u5f71\u54cd\u8106\u8089\u9ca9\u9c7c\u80cc\u808c\u8d28\u6784\u7279\u6027\u7684\u56e0\u7d20 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9d762e3766612e085faf99778594ca9cNeural Signature of Reconsolidation Impairments by Propranolol in Humans http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ddf3bd1320e6ee0a4a6d44717d0c912fEffects of rearing temperature and strain on sensory characteristics, texture, colour and fat of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f88545770207870efda63048fa13b2bcFunctional Roles of Fatty Acids and Their Effects on Human Health http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8f91b8ea644030b88b46ee185d166e0eEffects of fasting on the meat quality and fat deposition of commercial-size farmed gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata, L.) fed different dietary regimes. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c17294197e5ee8a52bc558711c956573References: The lipid composition and biochemistry of freshwater fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=38b3bb1371f693a57d1a9a4e5a0c45c6Molecular mechanisms of temperature compensation in poikilotherms. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d51232fadc32d6d490079088e0e1a5e9Comparative study of myosins present in the lateral muscle of some fish: species variations in myosin isoforms and their distribution in red, pink and whit... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=06015a984e92d617fde571eaf66e83efForce-velocity characteristics and metabolism of carp muscle fibres following temperature acclimation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f61bf686d07c0688cdf8e6a5412ca87bThe influence of temperature on muscle velocity and sustained performance in swimming carp. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=753a6f4bc6702373d53ffd2c5d2ff19bThe role of collagen in the quality and processing of fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9a84446ca144ca5ea1ea43345d588b00Molecular species of collagen in the intramuscular connective tissue of fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=89845e1c2b3003bc46a6321d171f8f4aResponses of Goldfish (Carassius auratus, L.)
