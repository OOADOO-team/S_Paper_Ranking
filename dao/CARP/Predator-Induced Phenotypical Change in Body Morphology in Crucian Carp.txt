name: Predator-Induced Phenotypical Change in Body Morphology in Crucian Carpurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM17778362public_in: 万方authors: Bronmark, C., Miner, J. G.,abstract: In a field experiment where the presence or absence of piscivorous pike (Esox lucius) in ponds was manipulated, the morphology of crucian carp (Carassius carassius) diverged, such that individuals became deeper bodied in pond sections with pike. A laboratory experiment confirmed that the presence of this predator induced a change in body morphology in the carp. Estimation of prey vulnerability to predation by pike, a gape-limited predator, revealed that this increase in body depth resulted in crucian carp reaching a size that provided refuge from predation. However, this change in morphology incurs a cost through an increase in drag when the carp are swimming. Because crucian carp are limited by resources in the absence of piscivores and by the substantial cost of the defensive morph in their presence, phenotypic plasticity should be the optimal strategy for this species.citations_number: 803Citation: A REVIEW OF TRAIT\u2010MEDIATED INDIRECT INTERACTIONS IN ECOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d2df955bfee0bf0e024ffe719e6ef583The scent of death: Chemosensory assessment of predation risk by prey animals http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dfc63b7b077b8b460d2ce2d50aa9818aSequence-Based Species Delimitation for the DNA Taxonomy of Undescribed Insects http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=97e690bb3d9908a418f52e862548dda8Body Size, Natural Selection, and Speciation in Sticklebacks http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=98cf339ee6fc7ab1bdbfb571aa9fec96Character Release and Displacement in Fishes: A Neglected Literature http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=22960bc79aa485be4d0d897021de9b92Chemical alarm signalling in aquatic predator-prey systems: a review and prospectus. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7ccde193b92c80ead96ef2b93a6d0750Morphological and Behavioral Plasticity of Larval Anurans in Response to Different Predators http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cfc0330860086342b1c43a1bb4e68757How much variance can be explained by ecologists and evolutionary biologists? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=baad90913f589991b53e6e669b4fc99bESTIMATING EFFECTS OF LIMITING FACTORS WITH REGRESSION QUANTILES http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fc48b29f2a6f6fd6c05811eb92efc1c7The nature of predation: prey dependent, ratio dependent or neither? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=df9d101cb2ed99b71d128299745edec8References: The Ontogenetic Niche and Species Interactions in Size-Structured Populations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3dd703dbfdc44473c77f1db7925c8ca9SKEPTICISM TOWARDS SANTA ROSALIA, OR WHY ARE THERE SO FEW KINDS OF ANIMALS? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bc173002818f13f05fa228a8ce1f765bJSTOR: Evolution, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Jan., 1981), pp. 124-138 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=36d8c0fd405fc5d46221d03c679fe049Larval Size and Recruitment Mechanisms in Fishes: Toward a Conceptual Framework http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=52e33ce72220a7e60facd9a80f0400e9Sympatric Speciation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=54460f05b25988207addffb868224672Disruptive Selection on Habitat Preference and the Evolution of Reproductive Isolation: A Simulation Study http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=20791680584df6f3a978de2932191552Predator-induced phenotypical change in body morphology in crucian carp. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4d42d7512e445104f25ef8028bf6d9d6The Role of Male Choice in the Assortative Mating of Anadromous and Non-Anadromous Sockeye Salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=88f259b365ce6b645eb6f3efb551a27cAn Assessment of Diet-Overlap Indexes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5b8fb6400a04c4c8f4139e895beca612Evolution of Feeding Preferences in Phytophagous Insects http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=447d311dba5e822e0f15ad465492c3e8Canalization Versus Developmental Conversion in a Spatially Variable Environment http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0fb12c84c7b725949a8d560251dc10d5Alarm signals in fishes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9004fe30ebf9cb3bd61e389a858f2186Predator avoidance and community structure: interactions among piscivores, planktivores, and plankton. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d684e1eefaf226150897ebbad84fee3aThe Nature of Prey Selection by Planktivorous Fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c4cc45d84d4be58bf988ed0bd3944726Experimental Analysis of Prey Selection by Largemouth Bass: Role of Predator Mouth Width and Prey Body Depth http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7903b25b2b6aa91f700290ecfa17425bThe Ecology and Evolution of Inducible Defenses in a Marine Bryozoan: Cues, Costs, and Consequences http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c940bceb2e3de34f6f322b0316e8b83aResource partitioning and niche shift in Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus and brown trout, Salmo trutta http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=20641319ffa0dfee0c2c316d2735cec4Predator-Induced Reaction Norms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e31c63aeeb2ef9f41b7880a9776fdbc8JSTOR: Evolution, Vol. 42, No. 5 (Sep., 1988), pp. 977-985 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=208a481e12dad698f605c81d5d9da96dMultilocus model of sympatric speciation.
