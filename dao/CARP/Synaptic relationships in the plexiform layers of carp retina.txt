name: Synaptic relationships in the plexiform layers of carp retinaurl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00343821public_in: Springerauthors: Witkovsky P,Dowling JE,abstract: The synaptic contacts made by carp retinal neurons were studied with electron microscopic techniques. Three kinds of contacts are described: (1) a conventional synapse in which an accumulation of agranular vesicles is found on the presynaptic side along with membrane densification of both pre- and postsynaptic elements; (2) a ribbon synapse in which a presynaptic ribbon surrounded by a halo of agranular vesicles faces two postsynaptic elements; and (3) close apposition of plasma membranes without any vesicle accumulation or membrane densification.In the external plexiform layer, conventional synapses between horizontal cells are described. Horizontal cells possess dense-core vesicles about 1,000 Ã… in diameter. Membranes of adjacent horizontal cells of the same type (external, intermediate or internal) are found closely apposed over broad regions.In the inner plexiform layer ribbon synapses occur only in bipolar cell terminals. The postsynaptic elements opposite the ribbon may be two amacrine processes or one amacrine process and one ganglion cell dendrite. Amacrine processes make conventional synaptic contacts onto bipolar terminals, other amacrine processes, amacrine cell bodies, ganglion cell dendrites and bodies. Amacrine cells possess dense-core vesicles. Ganglion cells are never presynaptic elements. Serial synapses between amacrine processes and reciprocal synapses between amacrine processes and bipolar terminals are described. The inner plexiform layer contains a large number of myelinated fibers which terminate near the layer of amacrine cells.citations_number: 217Citation: Electrical connexions between horizontal cells in the dogfish retina. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=93984ba1a7090130a7e203e3da847dcbDepletion and Replenishment of Vesicle Pools at a Ribbon-Type Synaptic Terminal http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d13c77a7c52e9b453390b4f92786c971The organization of the outer plexiform layer in the retina of the cat: electron microscopic observations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5970acce87d1992f60e5cf5bf3dba69dDopamine decreases conductance of the electrical junctions between cultured retinal horizontal cells. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=15c0ca8dfc78fc2c3f00c562568e2f3bOrganization of Vertebrate Retinas http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=16b1ad8e2415acacc14331f6b2d9c2c1A voltage-clamp analysis of membrane currents in solitary bipolar cells dissociated from Carassius auratus. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a966cd081bd710b17783125cea5fe8ccDopamine blocks carrier-mediated release of GABA from retinal horizontal cells. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ccb10fe363ed10ba3064b3e75b25debfRod and cone inputs to bipolar cells in goldfish retina. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=866409c2bb94a3d2ecc2c4db0cac8df3\u03b3 -aminobutyric Acid Exerts a Local Inhibitory Action on the Axon Terminal of Bipolar Cells: Evidence for Negative Feedback from Amacrine Cells http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bf17502efae102d864a40ce081c15ff6Membrane properties of solitary horizontal cells isolated from goldfish retina. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d9c0b0a10b6f7351440e2c5776faf41bReferences: The Physiology of Synapses http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f6d7613a97d7eb5a4ff89a813c2742d3Organization of the primate retina: electron microscopy http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8879de10061836c6f5469f3eefdcdc95The physiology of synapses. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=614fac5ea2d13655da9a064d4ab6688cRETINAL GANGLION CELLS RESPONDING SELECTIVELY TO DIRECTION AND SPEED OF IMAGE MOTION IN THE RABBIT http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b91b7bf6560483564f6bc251a587c7b5Synaptic organization of the frog retina: an electron microscopic analysis comparing the retinas of frogs and primates http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4d5209afbd440f828af22bbe69f6c22bAn electron microscopic study of synapse formation, receptor outer segment development, and other aspects of developing mouse retina. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9e182c25b29a404b9c716f35310a2624The Site of Visual Adaptation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=33ee086fcff9d54b6e197a0cb0b9015aElectrophysiological study of the mechanisms subserving color coding in the fish retina http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c937adfa4be80f1d720a3a314ceb72f4Colour-coded ganglion cells in the goldfish retina: extension of their receptive fields by means of new stimuli. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=997e01f4bce9b294b57a79cd678cff44TYPES OF VISUAL RESPONSE FROM SINGLE UNITS IN THE OPTIC TECTUM AND OPTIC NERVE OF THE GOLDFISH http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c3cc3827245aed9c8acd18e84b74ffc9Synapses of horizontal cells in rabbit and cat retinas http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=05ff4014173f2219a28afb28babafc65Receptive fields of single optic nerve fibers in a mammal with an all-cone retina.
