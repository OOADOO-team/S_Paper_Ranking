name: BIOACCUMULATION OF HEAVY METALS IN ORGANS OF FRESH WATER FISH CYPRINUS CARPIO (COMMON CARP)url: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03326011public_in: Springerauthors: VINODHINI R,NARAYANAN M,abstract: The objective of the present study is to determine the bioaccumulation of heavy metals in various organs of the fresh water fish exposed to heavy metal contaminated water system. The experimental fish was exposed to Cr, Ni, Cd and Pb at sublethal concentrations for periods of 32 days. The elements Cd, Pb, Ni and Cr were assayed using Shimadzu AA 6200 atomic absorption spectrophotometery and the results were given as Î¼/g dry wt. The accumulation of heavy metal gradually increases in liver during the heavy metal exposure period. All the results were statistically significant at p  Pb &gt; Ni &gt; Cr and Pb &gt; Cd &gt; Ni &gt; Cr. Similarly, in case of kidney and flesh tissues, the order was Pb &gt; Cd &gt; Cr &gt; Ni and Pb &gt; Cr &gt; Cd &gt; Ni. In all heavy metals, the bioaccumulation of lead and cadmium proportion was significantly increased in the tissues of Cyprinus carpio (Common carp).citations_number: 272Citation: Bioaccumulation of heavy metals in organs of fresh water fish Cyprinus carpio (Common carp) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ed197fffd0b0f5459cd7527cff513859Oil sands development contributes polycyclic aromatic compounds to the Athabasca River and its tributaries http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2cf68bb0c52ce55fc672ca4840f91ca4Heavy metal contamination and its indexing approach for river water. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=592c761046276ecbe1c26457fe877f99Analysis of some heavy metals in the riverine water, sediments and fish from river Ganges at Allahabad http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5bd1bb42e76a882fd83a3da403caea7aA review of potential methods of determining critical effect size for designing environmental monitoring programs. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0506ffc24c491aac210d346cfe62c0c9Soil and groundwater cleanup: benefits and limits of emerging technologies http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=134d638a0daeaae9128004717101048eEffect of cadmium on glutathione S-transferase and metallothionein gene expression in coho salmon liver, gill and olfactory tissues. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1289026beb7e352479ae42a5f26af76eBiodegradation of Cypermethrin by a newly isolated actinomycetes HU-S-01 from wastewater sludge http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=064b0df2cfb3252dc8898f94d74ec88dHeavy metals distribution in muscle, liver, kidney and gill of European catfish (Silurus glanis) from Italian Rivers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ec5eacb665c0ec0dfe450bd572331da8Phytoextraction potential of six plant species grown in multimetal contaminated soil http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7ae68f333fe5c5b409462d33251b4d60References: The Natural Flow Regime http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ab27aef270238bbc9808d131ab55b35cAssessment of Biotic Integrity Using Fish Communities http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ec461116f300c5bc7dc92820d1dce260How much water does a river need? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=934a042eda7a7eca41359c681341e8adPatterns in Freshwater Fish Ecology http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=afebc25b8f2a86329998761249035623Patterns in Freshwater Fish Ecology by William J.
