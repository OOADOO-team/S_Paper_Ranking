name: Genetic improvement of common carp strains using intraspecific hybridizationurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004484869400245Jpublic_in: Elsevierauthors: Bakos, J,Gorda, S,abstract: Some classical genetic methods such as mass selection or family selection used to improve the productivity of common carp have produced poor results, hybridisation experiments were carried out based on the crossbreeding of different genotypes. The crossing experiments used different strains of cultivated common carp maintained in the live gene bank of the Fish Culture Research Institute, Szarvas. Since 1965 more than 100 crossing combinations have been tested under different production conditions. For the most important quantitative characteristics such as survival, growth, feed conversion, slaughter value and quality of meat three outstanding hybrids had been identified. The Szarvas 215 mirror, the Szarvas P.31 scaly and the Szarvas P.34 scaly hybrids showed 20â€“25% higher productivity than the traditional races of common carp.citations_number: 92Citation: Genetic manipulations in aquaculture: a review of stock improvement by classical and modern technologies http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=23fd27e336b1f68823541495b0934066Heritability estimates for growth-related traits using microsatellite parentage assignment in juvenile common carp ( Cyprinus carpio L.) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2e2666a2872eb546b07b38d1ac7745d9A review of genetic improvement of the common carp (Cyrpinus carpio L.) and other cyprinids by crossbreeding, hybridization and selection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=819d80a7ad4c903309cc57467da9ec9fAbout the oldest domesticates among fishes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d45d2c68e6210c1accb9b1668b1623ffSelective breeding of quantitative traits in the common carp ( Cyprinus carpio): a review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e41960bc7081fe4cd24a4c71cd1b7607Genetic variation for growth at one and two summers of age in the common carp ( Cyprinus carpio L.): Heritability estimates and response to selection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=acc1be81b291fa37fa732027c7ea97ceGenetic parameter estimates for growth-related traits in Oujiang color common carp (Cyprinus carpio var. color) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=66a034727f04a2744fd733d38f7d13ceHeritability estimates for processing and quality traits in common carp ( Cyprinus carpio L.) using a molecular pedigree http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d4c9c98f9a1493410d7d21dcf9713ddcGenetic analysis of common carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) strains : I: Genetic parameters and heterosis for growth traits and survival http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=44c6514683065efc88cbf759759b09d3Evaluation of growth performance in a diallel cross of three strains of giant freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) in Vietnam http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7f618de64460cc9e1cf17db90aa022beReferences: Genetic variation in quantitative traits and selective breeding in fish and shellfish. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a552ba8e5bc8592ecc9776a924ddd96bA genotype\u2013environment interaction for growth rate in the common carp, growing in intensively manured pond http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=626ad0a59822f7f4b287607c0895eeb5Progeny-testing selection of tilapia broodstocks producing all-male hybrid progenies--preliminary results. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=da593a012ccb412aca8ef0b47bca6744Genetics of fish: A summary of discussion http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=07080bc57a1befd5b478b71d60a29095Genetics of fish: Applications to warm water fishes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8538a51d001919b63659e2eedc69cc10
