name: Debromination of the flame retardant decabromodiphenyl ether by juvenile carp (Cyprinus carpio) following dietary exposureurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM14740725public_in: 万方authors: Stapleton HM,Alaee M,Letcher RJ,abstract: The congener 2,2‘,3,3‘,4,4‘,5,5‘,6,6‘-decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE 209) is the primary component in a commonly used flame retardant known as decaBDE. This flame retardant constitutes approximately 80% of the world market demand for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Because this compound is very hydrophobic (log Kow ∼ 10), it has been suggested that BDE 209 has very low bioavailability, although debromination to more bioavailable metabolites has also been suggested to occur in fish tis- sues. In the present study, juvenile carp were exposed to BDE 209 amended food on a daily basis for 60 days, fol- lowed by a 40-day depuration period in which the fate of BDE 209 was monitored in whole fish and liver tissues sepa- rately. No net accumulation of BDE 209 was observed throughout the experiment despite an exposure concentration of 940 ng/day/fish. However, seven apparent debrominated products of BDE 209 accumulated in whole fish and liver tissues over the exposure period. These debrominated metabolites of...citations_number: 425Citation: Detailed polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) congener composition of the widely used penta-, octa-, and deca-PBDE technical
