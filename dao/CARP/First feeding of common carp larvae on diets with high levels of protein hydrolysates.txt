name: First feeding of common carp larvae on diets with high levels of protein hydrolysatesurl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1018368208323public_in: Springerauthors: A.P. Carvalho, A.-M. Escaffre, A. Oliva Teles,abstract: A 21 day feeding trial was carried out at 24 &amp;deg;C aiming to evaluate the effect of diets containing high levels of protein hydrolysates on growth, survival and body composition of common carp, Cyprinus carpio L., larvae since first feeding. Eight semipurified diets based on a fish protein hydrolysate (CPSP) with or without additional nitrogen sources, such as casein, casein hydrolysates or other hydrolysates from several origins, were tested, using a diet based on yeast as a reference. High survival rates of larvae were observed at the end of the trial for all experimental diets, ranging from 97%for the yeast diet to 71%when CPSP was used as the only nitrogen source. In terms of growth, the best results were achieved with the CPSP-casein diet (1:1) and the yeast-based diet (17.5 mm total length / 82.8 mg wet weight and 16.3 mm total length / 55.4 mg wet weight, respectively). Growth of larvae fed on diets with protein hydrolysates as the only nitrogen source was considerably lower than that of larvae fed a mixture of intact protein and protein hydrolysates.citations_number: 112Citation: Substitution of live food by formulated diets in marine fish larvae. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6d6bd59d508e0c7d993f4a577a8e45eeDigestive enzymes in fish larvae and juveniles--implications and applications to formulated diets. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0bab7deed1c3a8d05434b63599d0eb2dProtein hydrolysate vs. fish meal in compound diets for 10-day old sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax larvae. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c0c0c109e43ab8e68b6fd16da020d5b6Free amino acids are absorbed faster and assimilated more efficiently than protein in postlarval Senegal sole (Solea senegalensis). http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0f5b1de778ec8d40ccebbc3b77851f94The supply of amino acids during early feeding stages of marine fish larvae: a review of recent findings. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9ec6b9cadf0d3ff4596fb78ab44323ceA highly efficient microencapsulated food for rearing early larvae of marine fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0d2f738c734f79cb7c0a5e0ca3ee7597Expression and activities of pancreatic enzymes in developing sea bass larvae ( Dicentrarchus labrax ) in relation to intact and hydrolyzed dietary protein... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=91d5545bf9482f806bde9a02ac4dc78cThe utilization of diets containing high levels of fish protein hydrolysate by turbot ( Scophthalmus maximus ) juveniles http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fcaa4b6f91e4ffe545cc3ff6eb2d4841Effects of different dietary levels of fish protein hydrolysates on growth, digestive enzymes, gut microbiota, and resistance to Vibrio anguillarum in Euro... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3958c5c6c1694003e7d23fce9b1b7b5aDigestive physiology of marine fish larvae : Hormonal control and processing capacity for proteins, peptides and amino acids http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=95a43fce7961c42e03695a4dfc2b2268References: The physiology of digestion in fish larvae http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9b1d7ad5eb493c8790d7c63b153c59c6The physiology of digestion in fish larvae http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c1f5c058de811407a017c6526eac1a57The effect of dietary exogenous digestive enzymes on ingestion, assimilation, growth and survival of gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata, Sparidae, Linnaeus) ... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c9f0ba1677e25691471b0d7068d908e6Essentiality of dietary phospholipids for carp ( Cyprinus carpio L.) larvae http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=23b031d5d3fbcf7a5700905d819e20b7Nutrient requirements, supply and utilization in the context of carp culture http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3f2cc0807c60c45fd6db8bfee8b9ae2aRearing of coregonid ( Coregonus schinzi palea Cuv. et Val.) larvae using dry and live food : IV.
