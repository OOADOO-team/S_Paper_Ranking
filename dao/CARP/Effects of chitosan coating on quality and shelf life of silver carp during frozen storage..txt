name: Effects of chitosan coating on quality and shelf life of silver carp during frozen storage.url: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814608014088public_in: Elsevierauthors: Fan WenJiao,Sun JunXiu,Chen YunChuan,abstract: The effects of chitosan coating on quality and shelf life of silver carp during frozen storage were investigated. Fish samples were treated with aqueous solution of 2% chitosan, and then stored at −3 °C for 30 days. The control and the treated fish samples were analyzed periodically for microbiological (total viable count), chemical (pH, TBA, TVB-N, K-value), and sensory characteristics. The results indicated that the effect of chitosan coating on fish samples was to retain their good quality characteristics and extend the shelf life during frozen storage, which was supported by the results of microbiological, chemical, and sensory evaluation analyses.citations_number: 202Citation: Development of Edible Films and Coatings with Antimicrobial Activity
