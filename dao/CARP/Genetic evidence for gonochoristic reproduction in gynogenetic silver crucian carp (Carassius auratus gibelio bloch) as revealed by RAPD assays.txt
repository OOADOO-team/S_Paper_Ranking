name: Genetic evidence for gonochoristic reproduction in gynogenetic silver crucian carp (Carassius auratus gibelio bloch) as revealed by RAPD assaysurl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002390010113public_in: Springerauthors: Zhou, L,Wang, Y,Gui, JF,abstract: Sex evolution has been a debating focus in evolutionary genetics. In lower vertebrates of reptiles, amphibians, and fish, a species or a bioform reproduces either sexually or asexually but never both. A few species were found to consist of all females in fish. These all-female species can propagate by asexual reproduction modes, such as gynogenesis and hybridogenesis. However, the coexistence of sexuality and asexuality in a single species was recently noted only in a cyprinid fish silver crucian carp, Carassius auratus gibelio. This fish had been demonstrated to be capable of gynogenesis stimulated by sperm from other related species. Surprisingly, natural populations of this fish consist of a minor but significant portion (approx. 20%) of males. As different clones with specific phenotypic and genetic characteristics have been found, and RAPD markers specific to each clone have recently been identified, this fish offers many advantages for analyzing whether or not genetic recombination occurs between different clones. In this study, artificial propagation was performed in clone F and clone D. Ovulated eggs from clone F were divided into two parts and respectively inseminated with sperm from a clone D male and from a red common carp (Cyprinus carpio) male. The control clone D individuals were selected from gynogenetic offspring of clone D activated by sperm of red common carp. The phenotype and sex ratio in the experimental groups were also observed. Using RAPD molecular markers, which allow for reliable discrimination and genetic analysis of different clones, we have revealed direct molecular evidence for gonochoristic reproduction in the gynogenetic silver crucian carp and confirmed a previous hypothesis that the silver crucian carp might reproduce both gynogenetically and gonochoristically. Therefore, we conclude that the silver crucian carp possesses two reproductive modes, i.e., gynogenetic and gonochoristic reproduction. The response mechanism of two reproductive development modes may be the first discovery in vertebrates. Additionally, we discuss the evolutionary implication between gynogenetic and gonochoristic reproduction modes and the contribution of the minor proportion of males to genetic flexibility in the gynogenetic silver crucian carp.citations_number: 202Citation: Microsatellites within genes and ESTs of common carp and their applicability in silver crucian carp http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1f08334d97deabb165f4af9845bbbd1eEvolution of mitochondrial relationships and biogeography of Palearctic green toads (Bufo viridis subgroup) with insights in their genomic plasticity. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a15bd7db2cd55b039f36995237118b25\u5e94\u7528\u5fae\u536b\u661f\u6807\u8bb0\u5bf9\u96cc\u6838\u53d1\u80b2\u94f6\u9cab\u7684\u9057\u4f20\u591a\u6837\u6027\u521d\u63a2 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e4e2c676bc04d2e3a2a1cb25f7be0a14A molecular approach to detect hybridisation between crucian carp ( Carassius carassius ) and non-indigenous carp species ( Carassius spp. and Cyprinus car... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d2c83e126bec1b3b577185d7952b09e4A C-type lectin associated and translocated with cortical granules during oocyte maturation and egg fertilization in fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c315ef518c9b9f124ca95f9ba745d467Molecular basis and genetic improvement of economically important traits in aquaculture animals http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=29b0de5f9506f8e175cf4e89c8a6d858Differential gene expression in fully-grown oocytes between gynogenetic and gonochoristic crucian carps http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6623c1d9a1141b412dc55107c95fb6e9Genetic basis and breeding application of clonal diversity and dual reproduction modes in polyploid Carassius auratus gibelio http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9e758ada79a021b92705cd6b3a0301b0Molecular analysis of silver crucian carp (Carassius auratus gibelio Bloch) clones by SCAR markers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9448600950f6f5365150c4ac841dab0cPositive Selection on Multiple Antique Allelic Lineages of Transferrin in the Polyploid Carassius auratus http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=433c76bfe2e3ea6fd591548f47f7780eReferences: THE RELATION OF RECOMBINATION TO MUTATIONAL ADVANCE. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=50effba58d7586a43362ca3b9085b744Why sex and recombination?
