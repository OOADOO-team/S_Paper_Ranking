name: Protein nutrition in fish. 1. The utilization of dietary protein by young carpurl: http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/19721410173.htmlpublic_in: CAB Directauthors: OGINO,C,abstract: 1. For 30 days young carp were given purified diets with 1% yeast and no casein or up to 65% so that 8 diets had from 0.4 to 55% protein. Weight gain and deposition of protein increased as dietary protein increased to 38%, then levelled off. Deposition of protein/g eaten was greatest with 21% protein in the diet. Net protein utilization and protein efficiency ratio decreased as protein content ...citations_number: 111Citation: The lipid composition and biochemistry of freshwater fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=38b3bb1371f693a57d1a9a4e5a0c45c6Nutritional values of live organisms used in Japan for mass propagation of fish: A review http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ed5e5e6c285a15688dcc04082accd014Effects of variation in essential fatty acids in fish feeds on nutritive value of freshwater fish for humans http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ca3432b67c1988532e37559b681f1566Dietary Phosphorus Requirement of Channel Catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=97892131df734b05f8de48d9305cc0d8Fatty acid requirements in ontogeny of marine and freshwater fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=21f12f1a31c909856591a883aad404c4Requirement criteria for essential fatty acids. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1fa6ddd48b6118a23447917b1a7ea6fbRole of nutrients in skeletal metabolism and pathology in fish \u2014 An overview http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=916072ef6f68b76d118377625c764041Protein and amino acid requirements of fishes. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=99c1ce60e8a343db21befc3a752c8f1dRiboflavin requirements in carp and rainbow trout. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=43f4b44fded72ea3d6039259e6caed9cStrategies for further development of aquatic feeds http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ec0a257fa7936f78c859347ecade2149References:
