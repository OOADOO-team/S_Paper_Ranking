name: Induced ovulation and spawning of cultured freshwater fish in China: Advances in application of GnRH analogues and dopamine antagonistsurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0044848688900804public_in: Elsevierauthors: Richard E. Peter,HaoRen Lin,Glen Van Der Kraak,abstract: The Linpe method of induced ovulations and/or spawning of cultured fish consists of treatment with an analogue of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) plus a dopamine antagonist. Initial experiments on common carp, silver carp, mud carp, bream, grass carp, bighead carp, black carp and loach confirm that ovulation can be induced in each of these species by injection of pimozide or domperidone plus [D-Ala 6, Pro 9 NEt]-luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH-A) or [D-Arg 6, Trp 7, Leu 8, Pro 9 NEt-]-LHRH (sGnRH-A). Domperidone and sGnRH-A are preferred because of higher potencies in several species, allowing for their use at low dosages. For most species one set of simultaneous injections of the two drugs has proven sufficient to induce a high rate of ovulation within a predictable period of time. Ovulations are complete and ovulated eggs have been shown to be fertile. Hatching rates and fry survival are as high as high as with traditional methods of induced spawning. Subsequent reproductive cycles appear not to be altered by induced ovulation with the Linpe method. Although some refinement of dosages of drugs is required, the Linpe method has proven to be a highly successful procedure for induced ovulation and/or spawning of cultured freshwater fish in China.citations_number: 182Citation: Endocrine manipulations of spawning in cultured fish: from hormones to genes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cfef3242cbe746291ce6fa3178460507Endocrine control of gametogenesis and spawning induction in the carp http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=85dc5ef5962e05206760c1f4756ff9f8Neuroendocrine regulation of ovulation in fishes: basic and applied aspects http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=92edaab68edaba1bf17df8de6f1c4749Perspectives on fish gonadotropins and their receptors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ce6c963e971663ad88dddf756a218d72Differential actions of dopamine receptor subtypes on gonadotropin and growth hormone release in vitro in goldfish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7e07d0c4ee2e984e6159eb3e9d6c130bTestosterone and estradiol potentiate the serum gonadotropin response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone in goldfish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b9d95829f7fbcdae1588a57a629ffa83Manipulation of reproduction in farmed fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ce5d826ff76bc7533ea0be480d03eb99Dopamine Inhibits Luteinizing Hormone Synthesis and Release in the Juvenile European Eel: A Neuroendocrine Lock for the Onset of Puberty1 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f9fc2bbae861078c590fe6edd3c3ced9Use of a pituitary cell dispersion method and primary culture system for the studies of gonadotropin-releasing hormone action in the goldfish, Carassius au... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a76d285540418838af77b618e09b2681Spawning induction in common carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) using pituitary extract or GnRH superactive analogue combined with metoclopramide: analysis of hormon... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d2a81dedfb21a88c03eb958ba654fcd4References: Effects of catecholaminergic agonists and antagonists on serum gonadotropin concentrations and ovulation in goldfish: evidence for specificity of dopamine ... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=310b19348de8ae0df13cd604d19203baEffects of pimozide and des Gly 10 ,[ d -Ala 6 ]luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ethylamide on serum gonadotropin concentrations, germinal vesicle migration, and ovulation in female goldfish, Carassius auratus http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=26ce7b1ccda012996474ffeab1607ee4Induction of ovulation in goldfish, Carassius auratus , by pimozide and analogues of LH-RH http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=718585d9c7d04a2eaafa3cd89f2a3ac0In-vivo evaluation of dopamine receptor-mediated inhibition of gonadotrophin secretion from the pituitary gland of the goldfish, Carassius auratus http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8e47ac87ad49ecc81aa95f0517d7d601Seasonal effects of pimozide and des Gly 10 [ d -Ala 6 ] LH-RH ethylamide on gonadotrophin secretion in goldfish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3c56fd9a035d48c24149b5d36258a273Neuroendocrine Control of Reproduction in Teleosts http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5a59f00f96d62a57f7081076db561b61Effects of [ d -Ala 6 , Pro 9 -NEt]-LHRH and catecholaminergic drugs on gonadotropin secretion and ovulation in the Chinese loach ( Paramisgurnus dabryanus ) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7bccaf9166b0ed2120129a67cb735b9cInduction of ovulation in the loach ( Paramisgurnus dabryanus ) using pimozide and [D-Ala 6 , Pro 9 -N-ethylamide]-LHRH http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=79646163cdd4c08630a79d86020b95a3A FURTHER INVESTIGATION ON THE STIMULATORY EFFECT OF A SYNTHETIC ANALOGUE OF HYPOTHALAMIC LUTEINIZING HORMONE RELEASING HORMONE(LRH-A)ON SPAWNING IN \u201cDOMESTIC FISHES\u201d http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0e6577ebe785a9a01fbc02830901f7d5
