name: Histological changes induced by dietary phospholipids in intestine and liver of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) larvaeurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848697002718public_in: Elsevierauthors: Fontagne, Stephanie,Geurden, Inge,Escaffre, AnneMarie,abstract: Histological observations were made in common carp larvae in order to understand the origin of the phospholipid (PL) requirement of fish during their young stages. Larvae were fed for 6 or 8 days after start-feeding on semi-purified diets containing peanut oil and supplemented with or without different PL fractions enriched in phosphatidylcholine (PC) or phosphatidylinositol (PI). A group of larvae was also fed Artemia  nauplii. Dietary PL deficiency was associated with an accumulation of fat droplets in the enterocytes of the anterior intestine, an increase in height of mucosal epithelium, a reduced total liver volume and mean hepatocyte volume. In contrast, diet supplementation with PC from hen egg yolk or from soybean prevented the intestinal steatosis and resulted in larger liver volume and larger hepatocyte volume. Larvae fed Artemia  showed the same features as larvae fed PC-enriched diets. Hydrogenated PC also prevented the intestinal steatosis but resulted in small liver and hepatocyte size. Larvae fed PI-enriched diets exhibited intestinal steatosis, although less systematically than larvae fed PL-deficient diets, and reduced liver and hepatocyte size. Results support previous opinions that PL are needed for the absorption of neutral lipids although their beneficial effect appears to be independent of their emulsifying properties. The limiting stage seems to be the synthesis and exportation of chylomicrons or very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) by the enterocytes and not the intraluminal formation of micelles. PC appears to have a specific role for chylomicrons and VLDL synthesis and secretion, as in mammals. The reduced liver and hepatocyte size in the absence of PC could result from a decreased energy supply due to poor lipid absorption.citations_number: 202Citation: Metabolism and Functions of Lipids and Fatty Acids in Teleost Fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d3d049c4c92732390d972ffb4ceefcaeLipid nutrition of marine fish during early development: current status and future directions. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=54384ebf781841ec7844cea626fd2fceNutritional components affecting skeletal development in fish larvae http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3efb319eead8058a2a7cf2aaf2c93864Recent advances in lipid nutrition in fish larvae. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d798839d5458e5ebed4a614f95daa9aThe role of phospholipids in nutrition and metabolism of teleost fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=880a270c9c2104edae04fbeb19a81d43Optimising lipid nutrition in first-feeding flatfish larvae http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e63865f77f16106eb3c35a68b081b9bfEffect of dietary phospholipid level and phospholipid:neutral lipid value on the development of sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) larvae fed a compound diet. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1994906bcd0d79558c42a61e173256caOntogenetic development of the digestive system in California halibut ( Paralichthys californicus ) with notes on feeding practices http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=638a23e312e6061d7f1b2b03c678125eLipid digestibility and ultrastructural changes in the enterocytes of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus L.) fed linseed oil and soybean lecithin http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=baebae205f3866ef263e91faa093b111Development of the digestive tract of gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata L.).
