name: Hepatic glucokinase is induced by dietary carbohydrates in rainbow trout, gilthead seabream, and common carpurl: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10801283public_in: NCBIauthors: Panserat, S,Medale, F,Blin, C,abstract: Glucokinase (GK) plays a central role in glucose homeostasis in mammals. The absence of an inducible GK has been suggested to explain the poor utilization of dietary carbohydrates in rainbow trout. In this context, we analyzed GK expression in three fish species (rainbow trout, gilthead seabream, and common carp) known to differ in regard to their dietary carbohydrate tolerance. Fish were fed for 10 wk with either a diet containing a high level of digestible starch (&gt;20%) or a diet totally deprived of starch. Our data demonstrate an induction of GK gene expression and GK activity by dietary carbohydrates in all three species. These studies strongly suggest that low dietary carbohydrate utilization in rainbow trout is not due to the absence of inducible hepatic GK as previously suggested. Interestingly, we also observed a significantly lower GK expression in common carp (a glucose-tolerant fish) than in rainbow trout and gilthead seabream, which are generally considered as glucose intolerant. These data suggest that other biochemical mechanisms are implicated in the inability of rainbow trout and gilthead seabream to control blood glucose closely.citations_number: 208Citation: Glucose
