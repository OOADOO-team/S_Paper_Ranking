name: Microsatellite markers in common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.).url: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/40156025_Microsatellite_markers_in_common_carp_(Cyprinus_carpio_L.)public_in: ResearchGateauthors: Crooijmans, R.P.M.A,Bierboom, V.A.F,Komen, J,abstract: Abstract Microsatellite markers of the poly (CA) type in common carp ( Cyprinus carpio  L.) are described. Clones containing a (CA) repeat were isolated from a common carp genomic library and sequenced. The number of repeats found was high compared to mammals but comparable with other teleost fishes. Classification of the repeats (perfect, imperfect and compound) are compared with the Atlantic cod ( Gadus morhua  L.), rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ), and Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar  L.). A total of 41 primer sets were designed and tested for polymorphism on a test panel of eight animals (derived from outbred lines, inbred lines and gynogenetic clones). Thirty-two markers were found to be polymorphic. The heterozygosity in the outbred animals was 60路4%, 51路1% in the inbred animals and 0% in the gynogenetic clones. The average number of alleles among the eight animals was 4路7 per marker. Six markers (18路8%) gave an additional polymorphic amplification product besides the polymorphic amplification product in the expected size range. The possibility that these loci are tetraploid is discussed. The polymorphic loci described for common carp will be valuable as genetic markers for use in population, breeding, and evolutionary studies.citations_number: 402Citation: A genetic linkage map of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.)
