name: Suppression in function of phagocytic cells in common carp Cyprinus carpio L. injected with estradiol, progesterone or 11-ketotestosteroneurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S153204560200100Xpublic_in: Elsevierauthors: Hironobu Watanuki, Takafumi Yamaguchi, Masahiro Sakai,abstract: The modulation of phagocytic cells by beta-estradiol, 11-ketotestosterone, progesterone and cortisol was analysed in common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.). Carp were injected intraperitoneally (1 and 5 mug/kg fish) with each steroid and the activity of kidney macrophages was recorded 1 and 3 days post-injection. Bovine serum albumin-injected fish served as controls. Phagocytosis, superoxide anion and nitric oxide production were suppressed in all sex steroid treatments, and the suppression was in a dose-dependent manner. Cortisol treatment also inhibited the immune parameters to an extent similar to each of the steroid hormone. These results show that sex steroids can modulate the function of the phagocytic cells.citations_number: 99Citation: Proliferation and functional maturation of Sertoli cells, and their relevance to
