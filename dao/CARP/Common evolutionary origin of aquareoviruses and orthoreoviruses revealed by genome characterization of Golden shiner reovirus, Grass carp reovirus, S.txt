name: Common evolutionary origin of aquareoviruses and orthoreoviruses revealed by genome characterization of Golden shiner reovirus, Grass carp reovirus, Striped bass reovirus and golden ide reovirus (genus Aquareovirus, family Reoviridae)url: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM12124458public_in: 万方authors: Attoui, H,Fang, Q,Jaafar, FM,abstract: Full-length and partial genome sequences of four members of the genus Aquareovirus, family Reoviridae (Golden shiner reovirus, Grass carp reovirus, Striped bass reovirus and golden ide reovirus) were characterized. Based on sequence comparison, the unclassified Grass carp reovirus was shown to be a member of the species Aquareovirus C The status of golden ide reovirus, another unclassified aquareovirus, was also examined. Sequence analysis showed that it did not belong to the species Aquareovirus A or C, but assessment of its relationship to the species Aquareovirus B, D, E and F was hampered by the absence of genetic data from these species. In agreement with previous reports of ultrastructural resemblance between aquareoviruses and orthoreoviruses, genetic analysis revealed homology in the genes of the two groups. This homology concerned eight of the 11 segments of the aquareovirus genome (amino acid identity 17-42%), and similar genetic organization was observed in two other segments. The conserved terminal sequences in the genomes of members of the two groups were also similar. These data are undoubtedly an indication of the common evolutionary origin of these viruses. This clear genetic relatedness between members of distinct genera is unique within the family Reoviridae. Such a genetic relationship is usually observed between members of a single genus. However, the current taxonomic classification of aquareoviruses and orthoreoviruses in two different genera is supported by a number of characteristics, including their distinct G+C contents, unequal numbers of genome segments, absence of an antigenic relationship, different cytopathic effects and specific econiches.citations_number: 215Citation: Sequences of flavivirus-related RNA viruses persist in DNA form integrated in the genome of http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dd09a8d2aa3dbf3f6958b96fd670cb26Origins, evolution, and vector\/host coadaptations within the genus Flavivirus. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3231bf1949da3b309602c3566f6aa01aGenetic characterization of tick-borne flaviviruses: New insights into evolution, pathogenetic determinants and taxonomy http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=162541079d34d0918c13d4cc255b0bd6The zoonotic flaviviruses of southern, south-eastern and eastern Asia, and Australasia: the potential for emergent viruses. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=57425d5ac8391ada25cf85612ef1f997Structure and functionality in flavivirus NS-proteins: Perspectives for drug design http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6ac40b37b0e7cf27ff9dc9b19595142bA multigene analysis of the phylogenetic relationships among the flaviviruses (Family: Flaviviridae ) and the evolution of vector transmission http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d9cca7c0b73ba747c6a99d5b97e7cf7aIsolation of a new strain of the flavivirus cell fusing agent virus in a natural mosquito population from Puerto Rico http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d90df6767cf4cbbae97ebe09a2d6aaacIsolation and characterization of a new insect flavivirus from Aedes albopictus and Aedes flavopictus mosquitoes in Japan http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d4e531ca0de457b175613cdbdbacd24cSubnanometer-resolution Structures of the Grass Carp Reovirus Core and Virion http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=616f75d729b2c0bd01b73fd7a349ac40Heart and Skeletal Muscle Inflammation of Farmed Salmon Is Associated with Infection with a Novel Reovirus http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cc3104e6f0568140a75c1eb777170222References: Classification and nomenclature of viruses. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1b6572a88cc61fbf2f1f3551b9a38816Strategies for the sequence determination of viral dsRNA genomes. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=72e10bcbd057ee71b814225836f6d100Segment-Specific Inverted Repeats Found Adjacent to Conserved Terminal Sequences in Wound Tumor Virus Genome and Defective Interfering RNAs http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b6600166d9885c2b8c26d8584ef5491bSequence of genome segments 1, 2, and 3 of the grass carp reovirus (Genus Aquareovirus, family Reoviridae) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=97ab5b5c9c821efabf36e0aa3c7395e6The structure of aquareovirus shows how the different geometries of the two layers of the capsid are reconciled to provide symmetrical interactions and sta... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fc1fc1779e20a4c24c2ed0e35dcbe488Morphological and biochemical properties of four members of a novel group of reoviruses isolated from aquatic animals http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8a284fd9c58a91bf01c8015e7e105f88The 3'-terminal sequence of a wound tumor virus transcript can influence conformational and functional properties associated with the 5'-terminus. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=645558ad33b6606bd788e4e2176188e9Genus Coltivirus (family Reoviridae): genomic and morphologic characterization of Old World and New World viruses. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=932150b7377b35c745ab069ba0e1cdf2Fish Viruses: A Double-Stranded RNA Icosahedral Virus from a North Ame... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=71d2a46369ebdbb6e13ce1b8764499f5Morphological and genomic characterization of two reoviruses (P and W2) pathogenic for marine crustaceans; do they constitute a novel genus of the Reovirid... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=82668df1c5da78cccd35e73fd7dbdaa8MORPHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICO-CHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE HEMORRHAGIC VIRUS OF GRASS CARP http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e85b86da42d361d46fd555687d011a37Characterization of the polypeptides and determination of genome coding assignments of an aquareovirus. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=145f32e70933951e9a8dec4d0db343b3Preliminary characterization of a reovirus isolated from golden ide Leuciscus idus melanotus. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0fc377127939fb7c241a613402a0d678
