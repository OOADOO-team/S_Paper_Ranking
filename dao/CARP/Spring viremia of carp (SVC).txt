name: Spring viremia of carp (SVC)url: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM12553453public_in: 万方authors: Ahne, W, Bjorklund, HV, Essbauer, S,abstract: Spring viremia of carp (SVC) is an important disease affecting cyprinids, mainly common carp Cyprinus carpio. The disease is widespread in European carp culture, where it causes significant morbidity and mortality. Designated a notifiable disease by the Office International des Epizooties, SVC is caused by a rhabdovirus, spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV). Affected fish show destruction of tissues in the kidney, spleen and liver, leading to hemorrhage, loss of water-salt balance and impairment of immune response. High mortality occurs at water temperatures of 10 to 17degreesC, typically in spring. At higher temperatures, infected carp develop humoral antibodies that can neutralize the spread of virus and such carp are protected against re-infection by solid immunity. The virus is shed mostly with the feces and urine of clinically infected fish and by carriers. Waterborne transmission is believed to be the primary route of infection, but bloodsucking parasites like leeches and the carp louse may serve as mechanical vectors of SVCV. The genome of SVCV is composed of a single molecule of linear, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA containing 5 genes in the order 3&#039;-NPMGL-5&#039; coding for the viral nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, matrix protein, glycoprotein, and polymerase, respectively. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the viral proteins, and sequence homologies between the genes and gene junctions of SVCV and vesicular stomatitis viruses, have led to the placement of the virus as a tentative member of the genus Vesiculovirus in the family Rhabdoviridae. These methods also revealed that SVCV is not related to fish rhabdoviruses of the genus Novirhabdovirus. In vitro replication of SVCV takes place in the cytoplasm of cultured cells of fish, bird and mammalian origin at temperatures of 4 to 3 VC, with an optimum of about 20degreesC. Spring viremia of carp can be diagnosed by clinical signs, isolation of virus in cell culture and molecular methods. Antibodies directed against SVCV react with the homologous virus in serum neutralization, immunofluorescence, immunoperoxidase, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, but they cross-react to various degrees with the pike fry rhabdovirus (PFR), suggesting the 2 viruses are closely related. However, SVCV and PFR can be distinguished by certain serological tests and molecular methods such as the ribonuclease protection assay.citations_number: 194Citation: A star with stripes: zebrafish as an infection model. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=28d7ce3f1c650c52b0673fe9610e36abSpring viremia of carp (SVC). http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e151867d528d9551297158f319535127Emerging viral diseases of fish and shrimp http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a5379bf24ab61e351c5f9ba49a1552d7Molecular comparison of isolates of an emerging fish pathogen, koi herpesvirus, and the effect of water temperature on mortality of experimentally infected... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=00c9f1d057677064b1d314fab3d7a2d3Susceptibility of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to a model pathogen, spring viremia of carp virus. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d613456d2720ff47c2838f9fafff6dd2A comparative review on European-farmed finfish RNA viruses and their vaccines. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a99408c0c63b0ee4e368eb5365fc7b57Mortality and herpesvirus infections of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas in Tomales Bay, California, USA http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=522959199700368e9b0e5020de8d3830Fish Rhabdoviruses: Molecular Epidemiology and Evolution http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bc7f96a2c604abf92677e908b1f21e9bFirst Report of Spring Viremia of Carp Virus (SVCV) in Wild Common Carp in North America http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4ae045e0ed9f18080bd14faa95e02563Characterization of complete genome sequence of the spring viremia of carp virus isolated from common carp (Cyprinus carpio) in China http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fe80b4c7c3d35ba7c8c2b74798d3f3b3References: Rapid evolution of RNA viruses. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=505b9fbc7c4a6f9c7f82bdf662df9b5cSome properties of the Epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cell line from carp cyprinus carpio http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d1b8a2380bac678df6cdd26475fdbca1Sequence Comparison of Five Polymerases (L proteins) of Unsegmented Negative-strand RNA Viruses: Theoretical Assignment of Functional Domains http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6ed4d6dcb40af17a3700cb013c30d7caDNA Vaccines Encoding Viral Glycoproteins Induce Nonspecific Immunity and Mx Protein Synthesis in Fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6ad7c6ecb003d8f2668234d65a09431eSpring viremia of carp (SVC). http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e151867d528d9551297158f319535127Isolation of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) from wild marine fish species in the Baltic Sea, Kattegat, Skagerrak and the North Sea http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f1852af47a4951a8a629785c878c656bMolecular biology of animal viruses http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6345e95524a2200caef9f98892878db6The glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus is the antigen that gives rise to and reacts with neutralizing antibody. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=57d2f8014a3f98189d4bba08d95f7f0aNanogram quantities of a DNA vaccine protect rainbow trout fry against heterologous strains of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3d006c2d126cc08c3148e8d43b61c3d0The molecular biology of animal viruses.
