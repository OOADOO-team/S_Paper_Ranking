name: 8-Isoprostane, a Marker of Oxidative Stress, Is Increased in Exhaled Breath Condensate of Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea After Night and Is Reduced by Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Therapyurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM14555570public_in: 万方authors: Carpagnano, Giovanna E., Kharitonov, Sergei A., Resta, Onofrio,abstract: Study objectives: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by recurrent apnea during sleep that may compromise oxidative balance. Oxidative stress is increased in the blood and in the airways of OSA patients. Design: The aim of this study was to investigate whether oxidative stress is determined by nocturnal apneas and could be reduced by CPAP therapy, and whether there is a relation between local and systemic oxidative stress in these patients. Patients and methods: Eighteen patients with OSA (13 men; mean (+-SD) age, 48+-3 years) and 12 healthy age-matched and weight-matched subjects (8 men; mean age, 46+-7 years) were recruited. 8-Isoprostane was measured in exhaled breath condensate and blood by a specific enzyme immunoassay. Measurements and results: Higher concentrations of 8-isoprostane were found in the morning exhaled condensate (9.5+-1.9 pg/mL) and plasma (9.7+-1.5 pg/mL) of OSA patients compared to healthy obese subjects (6.7+-0.2 and 7.1+-0.3 pg/mL, respectively; p&lt;0.0001). Elevated mean concentrations of exhaled 8-isoprostane were observed in the OSA patients at 8:00 AM (9.5+-1.9 pg/mL) but not at 8:00 PM (7.6+-0.8 pg/mL; p&lt;0.0005), and a significant reduction was seen after continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy (7.7+-0.9 pg/mL; before treatment, 9.6+-1.7 pg/mL; p&lt;0.005). A positive correlation was found between morning exhaled 8-isoprostane levels and the apnea-hypopnea index (r=0.8; p&lt;0.0001), and 8-isoprostane levels and neck circumference (r=0.6; p&lt;0.0001). Conclusions: These findings suggest that systemic and local oxidative stress are increased in OSA patients, and that they are higher after nocturnal apnea and reduced by CPAP therapy.citations_number: 376Citation: ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure 2012 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ea80652255f78e9e9a76f6bcc1510c2aSystemic manifestations and comorbidities of COPD. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5ea181d4ec68b61caf53990358b6571fObstructive sleep apnoea and its cardiovascular consequences. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f844435f6ae4ac39463bac46edbb499cSleep apnoea as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease: current evidence, basic mechanisms and research priorities. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=99430dcacb21ae72a3f79b87f3cd3903Continuous positive airway pressure treatment rapidly improves insulin sensitivity in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c98d8196ffa8956e076d6ba067aaa3eaEffect of leptin on allergic airway responses in mice. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a2e6a456043a04003eb97e332c3799dfOxidative stress in obstructive sleep apnea http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=607ad077f8c3eab4bc5e1aca5c1329e4Effects of continuous positive airway pressure on early signs of atherosclerosis in obstructive sleep apnea. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6d991a59b07a32513600483644615620Early signs of atherosclerosis in obstructive sleep apnea http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a7fa0f3200e56ffe64f2e6a529268237Inflammation, Oxidative Stress, and Repair Capacity of the Vascular Endothelium in Obstructive Sleep Apnea http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=90ee9dc0f649cca5c93d6c605be91609References: A manual of standardized terminology, techniques and scoring system for sleep stages of human subjects : A.
