name: Stress Responses and Changes in Protein Metabolism in Carp Cyprinus carpio during Cadmium Exposureurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM11222034public_in: 万方authors: Hans De Smet, Ronny Blust,abstract: Stress responses and changes in protein metabolism were studied in common carp Cyprinus carpio exposed to 0, 0.8, 4, and 20 muM cadmium (Cd) over a 29-day period. Blood and other tissue samples were taken after 4 and 29 days of exposure. The highest Cd concentration proved to be lethal to the fish, resulting in 100% mortality after 21 days of exposure. Cd accumulated in the tissues in the following order: kidney&gt; liver&gt; gills. Blood hematocrit, blood hemoglobin, plasma glucose, plasma lactate, and tissue total protein contents were not significantly altered. The concentrations of Cd and zinc (Zn) binding metallothioneins ((Cd, Zn)-MTs) were in the following order: liver &gt; kidney gills. An increase in (Cd, Zn)-MTs was observed at all exposure concentrations at days 4 and 29 in kidney and at Day 29 in gills. No significant changes in (Cd, Zn)-MT contents were found in liver. The concentrations of free amino acids and the activities of proteases were increased at Day 4 in gills, liver, and kidney of carp exposed to 4 and 20 muM Cd, and in gills and kidney at Day 29 in carp exposed to 4 Cd. The observed increases in the activities of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase suggest that the observed proteolysis is intended to increase the role of proteins in the energy production during Cd stress. However, this increased activity of both aminotransferases was not found in gills during exposure to the lethal Cd concentration, indicating that Cd may also cause an inhibitory effect on the activity of these enzymes above a certain level.citations_number: 153Citation: Evaluation of potential reference genes in real-time RT-PCR studies of Atlantic salmon http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c90097b521e94e7937edf54ee06e8902The effects of environmental pollutants on complex fish behaviour: integrating behavioural and physiological indicators of toxicity. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2e7f1cce27321aa81d39fd7620244157Developmental Toxicology of Cadmium in Living Embryos of a Stable Transgenic Zebrafish Line http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4706dfe43feb616af2a79b6e52d5a12bMolecular control mechanisms of fish spermatogenesis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=63f765ce7a6a26260c6cfc2c4026ca62Effects of dietary calcium and cadmium on cadmium accumulation, calcium and cadmium uptake from the water, and their interactions in juvenile rainbow trout http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=530266884ee855f3680957cc6aa9c794Low-frequency electromagnetic fields induce a stress effect upon higher plants, as evident by the universal stress signal, alanine. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0b8ef4024dc0d2776a6149f7d7ae2ef6Biomarkers of a native fish species (Cnesterodon decemmaculatus) application to the water toxicity assessment of a peri-urban polluted river of Argentina. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=723e4830e8d61fa484a1f5d9846a1ff9Nitrite toxicity in Cirrhinus mrigala (Ham.): acute toxicity and sub-lethal effect on selected haematological parameters. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=87dc84e804ee48e7af7b2d2b577a3339Reproductive Endocrinology of the European Eel, Anguilla anguilla http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=06cf7e9a9472ee7c200d3ba596346229Induction and Binding of Cd, Cu, and Zn to Metallothionein in Carp (Cyprinus carpio) Using HPLC-ICP-TOFMS http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fe4f68accaf507980cec6cf6f133bc4eReferences: Metallothioneins in metal regulation and toxicity in aquatic animals http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=99bf37f1cbb728eb67631a29c0b97105Metallothionein and its role in toxic metal regulation \u2606 \u2606\u2606 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=15ba4f5d5d1579bfaa8a4a2023095c46Metallothioneins: historical review and state of knowledge. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=01c8e7573cd86af519ecdb91b9660791Metabolic Responses Associated with Confinement Stress in Tilapia: The Role of Cortisol http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f3975df93ad4da5b1f99fc3c0148360eFunctional enzymes activity and gill histology of carp after copper sulfate exposure and recovery http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a81bec57c90fd2efc71b02f59a7d2614Evaluation of microwave heating digestion and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry with continuum source background correction for the determina... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1544fef77dca177a40226707f0097526Separation and purification of (Cd, Cu, Zn)-metallothionein in carp hepato-pancreas http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a1037f3b2a6dd0fec4b818ee744f515cFormation of metallothionein in fish. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=650ed9ba97c6af3d8252255e0bd8328bThermal acclimation in fish: conservative and labile properties of swi... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0e4a36868e61c3c151fde1e758900edeChanges in oxidative metabolism in selected tissues of the crab (Scylla serrata) in response to cadmium toxicity http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d4a380af6318759263ea924fcae3c4fdUptake and tissue distribution of dietary and aqueous cadmium by carp (Cyprinus carpio) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=29806cdeefcfb8669bb52097d7c89ec0The Cd-Chelex assay: A new sensitive method to determine metallothionein containing zinc and cadmium http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=60c5db80ab4529f21fc28126b22d8633Cadmium bioaccumulation in carp (Cyprinus carpio) tissues during long-term high exposure: analysis by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6419b263bf90f7b4acbe481a3aa994aaHeavy metal intracellular balance and relationship with metallothionein induction in the liver of carp after contamination by silver, cadmium and mercury f... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5152b47aa9b7e01348b1899cec520c6dInfluence of handling and\/or anaesthesia on stress response in rainbow trout.
