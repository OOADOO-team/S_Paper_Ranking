name: Isolation and Characterization of Acid-soluble and Pepsin-soluble Collagens from Skin of Grass Carp(Ctenopharyngodon idellus)url: http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-SPKX200612140.htmpublic_in: 知网authors: ZHANG Jian-zhong,AN Xin-xin,WANG Lin,abstract: Acid-soluble and pepsin-soluble collagens (ASC and PSC) were extracted from the skin of grass carp and partially characterized. The yields of ASC and PSC on dry basis from grass carp were 8.0 % and 18.6% respectively. The UV spectra of ASC and PSC from grass carp showed that the distinct absorption was obtained near 223 nm; SDS-PAGE showed that the collagens were composed of two distinct alpha chains, which is similar to the porcine type I collagen. The denaturation temperature of ASC and PSC from grass carp was 33.8℃ and 34.5℃ respectively lower about 3℃ than that of the porcine skin collagen (37℃). These results suggest that grass carp skin has potential application in the functional food, healthcare, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.citations_number: 203Citation: Properties of collagen from skin, scale and bone of carp (Cyprinus carpio) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=65e35a56c0940ff29b18372294b98d38Isolation and characterisation of collagen extracted from the skin of striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ee8f8640704341dc32ff3b3f07733f09Collagen for bone tissue regeneration. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=65b9f2928370c675c0a3a6e62313650cCharacterization of acid-soluble collagen from the skin of walleye pollock ( Theragra chalcogramma ) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3e793ea827e44f77003c4d2711f4b4b7Extraction and characterisation of pepsin-solubilised collagens from the skin of bigeye snapper (Priacanthus tayenus and Priacanthus macracanthus) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a9415677578fd7dc62095248ca31153aIsolation and characterisation of collagens from the skin of largefin longbarbel catfish (Mystus macropterus) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=201060fccee2e2fe3a800fe6ee01b79eExtraction and characterisation of pepsin-solubilised collagen from the skin of unicorn leatherjacket (Aluterus monocerous) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3ea866d6824f629019ef0dae191b8d47Isolation and characterization of acid and pepsin-solubilized collagens from the skin of balloon fish (Diodon holocanthus) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c9bf73a213477366cdd340d2827fd22dIsolation and characterization of collagen from the skin of deep-sea redfish (Sebastes mentella) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fc4a8748bd82a5f54a57576ff78ae3acIsolation and characterization of acid soluble collagens and pepsin soluble collagens from the skin and bone of Spanish mackerel ( Scomberomorous niphonius ) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=80f92ba69ab2d023f588fa8bc5b2c9afReferences: Isolation of collagen from fish waste material--skin, bone and fins. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ee4fc73041618671727f947169196f95Fourier transform IR spectroscopy of collagen and gelatin solutions: deconvolution of the amide I band for conformational studies http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e2b5ee5c478c4b5b7ad6a90f8fbcb1b4Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic study of acid soluble collagen and gelatin from skins and bones of young and adult Nile perch ( Lates nilot... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=466dd718943c40b4e2ce88bd96da29acPossible Involvement of Aminotelopeptide in Self-assembly and Thermal Stability of Collagen I as Revealed by Its Removal with Proteases http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ce163fa922fffbd00a2ffad40998f1d1Biochemical Properties of Black Drum and Sheepshead Seabream Skin Collagen http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b8fe62ea2b73b010f3abca4094d26a30Comparison of physical-chemical properties of type I collagen from different species http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2a2e203981db298bacdee2234c5bf10fStudies on Rana tigerina skin collagen http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=31954888a97acee23c66535bb7bbe911The Protection of Freshwater Fish Natural Resources and the Sustainable Development http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=99748dd8f504c9da470446087b0b5a08
