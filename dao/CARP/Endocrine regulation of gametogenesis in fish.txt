name: Endocrine regulation of gametogenesis in fishurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM7981031public_in: 万方authors: Y, Nagahama,abstract: The pituitary-gonadal axis plays an important role in regulating gametogenesis in vertebrates. In most cases, gonadotropins act through the biosynthesis of gonadal steroid hormones which in turn mediate various stages of gametogenesis. A series of studies in our laboratory using several species of teleost fishes as experimental animals has provided new information about the endocrine regulation of gametogenesis, including oocyte growth, oocyte maturation, spermatogenesis and sperm maturation. This article briefly reviews our findings on the identification of steroidal mediators involved in each process of gametogenesis, and the sites and mechanisms of action of the mediators. These observations collectively demonstrate the appropriateness of using teleost fishes as valid models for examining hormonal influences on gametogenesis. Such models could also have applications and validity for vertebrates in general.citations_number: 730Citation: Sex determination and sex differentiation in fish: an overview of genetic, physiological, and environmental influences. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c123454ff1094b692487cfd1080a43b6Hsp90 as a capacitor of phenotypic variation. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a2825320466b407088da460611e25a35Sperm competition in fishes: the evolution of testis size and ejaculate characteristics. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2b6dca2f18abda6439df35658e17a8d2Oocyte growth and development in teleosts http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=21d4f0aaf94c37a7d8ec1bd916f36b4dSpermatozoal traits and sperm competition in Atlantic salmon: relative sperm velocity is the primary determinant of fertilization success. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d2a6d54ebc1aa6a2cfdc2306273432fbLong-Term Exposure to Environmental Concentrations of the Pharmaceutical Ethynylestradiol Causes Reproductive Failure in Fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=225375305754e55e5380e7efbb6fbf2eEndocrine and environmental aspects of sex differentiation in fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=651b84bafd74679764a3a72bef7a40baSperm competition in fish: `bourgeois' males and parasitic spawning http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4b06b7ab50c1b32cf022e31f4d52b1e0REVIEW:SPERM MOTILITY IN FISHES.
