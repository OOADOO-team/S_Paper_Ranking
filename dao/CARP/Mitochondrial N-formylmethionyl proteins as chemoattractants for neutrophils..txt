name: Mitochondrial N-formylmethionyl proteins as chemoattractants for neutrophils.url: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM6274994public_in: 万方authors: H Carp,abstract: Mitochondria synthesize several hydrophobic proteins. Like bacteria, mitochondria initiate protein synthesis with an N-formylmethionine residue. Because N-formylmethionyl peptides have been found to be chemotactic for polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), mitochondria isolated from cultured human cells and purified bovine mitochondrial proteins were tested for PMN chemotactic activity in vitro. Nondisrupted mitochondria were not chemotactic. However, intact mitochondria that had been incubated with a lysosomal lysate did stimulate PMN migration. Antibodies directed against two mitochondrial enzymes, cytochrome oxidase and ATPase, (both of which contain mitochondrially synthesized subunits) but not anti-C3 or anti-C5 decreased mitochondrially derived chemotactic activity. In addition, purified bovine mitochondrial N-formylmethionyl proteins stimulated PMN migration in vitro, whereas nonformylated mitochondrial proteins did not. Furthermore, the chemotactic activity of purified mitochondrial proteins and disrupted mitochondria was decreased by the formyl peptide antagonist butyloxycarbonyl-phenylalanine-leucine-phenylalanine-leucine-phenylalanine. Finally, disrupted mitochondria and purified mitochondrial proteins stimulated PMN-directed migration (chemotaxis), according to accepted criteria. In addition to other chemotactic factors, release of N-formylmethionyl proteins from mitochondria at sites of tissue damage, may play a role in the accumulation of inflammatory cells at these sites.citations_number: 330Citation: Shock and tissue injury induced by recombinant human cachectin http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1f5deb2cb25b5e57e6b1a2d14771da29Points of control in inflammation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=729699289eb4ece24166d44c737575b5The molecular biology of leukocyte chemoattractant receptors. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=48dd0b3aaf6358994266e2406d7dd4b1Essential contribution of caspase 3\/CPP32 to apoptosis and its associated nuclear\u2009changes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d4b3f46d2b7823d8bc5586964d91180GPR120 is an omega-3 fatty acid receptor mediating potent anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing effects. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bd3fc31cfd402ce603486e5e7f374cd3How dying cells alert the immune system to danger http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3d27755b26a40abdd79f0ea4647be0b5Neutrophil activation on biological surfaces.
