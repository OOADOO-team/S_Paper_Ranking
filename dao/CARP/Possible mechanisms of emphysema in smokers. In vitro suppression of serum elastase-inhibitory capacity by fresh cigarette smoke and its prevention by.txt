name: Possible mechanisms of emphysema in smokers. In vitro suppression of serum elastase-inhibitory capacity by fresh cigarette smoke and its prevention by antioxidants.url: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM101105public_in: 万方authors: Carp H,Janoff A,abstract: Abstract Freshly prepared, aqueous solutions of cigarette smoke suppressed the elastase-inhibitory capacity of human serum. Immunoelectrophoresis of mixtures of aqueous smoke solution, human serum, and pancreatic elastase showed decreased elastase/alpha1-proteinase inhibitor complexes and increased free, active protease. Phenolic antioxidants prevented the suppression of serum elastase-inhibition by cigarette smoke. By contrast, treatment of serum with model oxidants caused a similar suppression of elastase inhibition. These results suggested that emphysema in cigarette smokers might be due, in part, to the local suppression of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor in lung by oxidizing agents present in cigarette smoke.citations_number: 411Citation: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: molecular and cellular mechanisms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=433beb526469235895c62b6900d4a9ddHuman Plasma Proteinase Inhibitors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c626a0d1c2a75245245c4c214e080196Free-radical chemistry of cigarette smoke and its toxicological implications. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=620c73734c534d39665a8179f665bcd9Cigarette smoking, emphysema, and damage to alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a8e6d2ba2646d8c6e9d78159799eea29Elastases and emphysema.
