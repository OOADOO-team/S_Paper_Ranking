name: Responsiveness and receptive field size of carp horizontal cells are reduced by prolonged darkness and dopamineurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM4035351public_in: 万方authors: Mangel, S., Dowling, J.,abstract: In the fish retina the interplexiform cells contain dopamine and provide a trifugal pathway from the inner plexiform layer to horizontal cells of the outer plexiform layer. Dopamine application reduced the responsiveness and receptive field size of cone horizontal cells, as did a prolonged period of complete darkness. Other results suggest that the interplexiform cells may release dopamine after a longed period in the dark. The interplexiform-horizontal cell system may modify strength of the antagonistic surrounds of retinal neurons as a function of time in dark.citations_number: 260Citation: A Circadian Clock Regulates Rod and Cone Input to Fish Retinal Cone Horizontal Cells http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8ab58074b73f28eb4cbaf37d35d63072Dopamine enhances excitatory amino acid-gated conductances in cultured retinal horizontal cells http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=50f9b5985d7428a36e509b6f56e42d47Transmitter circuits in the vertebrate retina. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=814c3efe69e54f0431ee58b8ec5f807fLocalization and function of dopamine in the adult vertebrate retina http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=41ba8d930a8100d202e76d6c0a6a8c45Circadian rhythmicity in vertebrate retinas: Regulation by a photoreceptor oscillator http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=95aeae64828cdc49444c3edda988150eEarly-stage visual processing deficits in schizophrenia http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8aaa1ae243074a1d099bf4c1dc84ae2fThe diverse functional roles and regulation of neuronal gap junctions in the retina http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=de08640829b4cd9787125c1e37b1e3daVisual Perception and Its Impairment in Schizophrenia http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0e1b3c110d2d17c3901469268324b528Modulation of cone horizontal cell activity in the teleost fish retina.
