name: Anaerobic wintering of crucian carp (Carassius carassius L.)-I. Annual dynamics of glycogen reserves in natureurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0300962985904852public_in: Elsevierauthors: Hyv?rinen, H, Holopainen, I.J, Piironen, J,abstract: 1. 1. Seasonal variation in liver size (2&amp;#x2013;15% of total weight) as well as in liver and muscle glycogen content (2%&amp;#x2013;35% and 0.5&amp;#x2013;4%, respectively) of crucian carp were shown to be prominent in natural ponds with winter anoxia.2. 2. The histological structure of liver followed the glycogen dynamics. In spring part of the liver resembled haemopoetic tissue with structures like thyroid follicles enclosed.3. 3. The activity peak of liver lipase-esterases suggests active lipid metabolism in mid-summer only.4. 4. The activities of glycogen phosphorylase and glucose-6-phosphatase varied not only seasonally but between years, too.5. 5. The activity of glycogen phosphorylase in red and heart muscle was 2&amp;#x2013;3 times that in white muscle.citations_number: 106Citation: Intercontinental Comparison of Small-Lake Fish Assemblages: The Balance between Local and Regional Processes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f7e88064ef23d88ed02a1545a89a594eMechanisms of cell survival in hypoxia and hypothermia. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3dd2e2675a20a5f03a9ae9b9422d015bFish gill morphology: inside out http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=067b6cc1fb9564951551acf0ee908dbaOxidative stress and antioxidant defenses in goldfish Carassius auratus during anoxia and reoxygenation. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=16e73c4b70bc1f44e2df5a4331e513d5ECOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF HIBERNATION AND OVERWINTERING AMONG FRESHWATER FISHES, TURTLES, AND SNAKES http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b6021fea101ef52847a51afde0fe8afHypoxia induces adaptive and reversible gross morphological changes in crucian carp gills http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4acabb853ef310771150d46946f6b6baOxygen-dependent gene expression in fishes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7f835f1276f3498ab6b71e447e950a9aHypometabolic homeostasis in overwintering aquatic amphibians http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6c5fe984bd05d1038f26fef6bbe8d0d7Hypoxic survival strategies in two fishes: extreme anoxia tolerance in the North European crucian carp and natural hypoxic preconditioning in a coral-reef ... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3126d0276c177cc35c31333d8905a086Contrasting strategies for anoxic brain survival--glycolysis up or down. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1a90b320c9bbf36b67dc7b04ac4e2441References: Patterns in the Species Composition and Richness of Fish Assemblages in Northern Wisconsin Lakes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=85389dc979547f38836b02d38c301302Ethanol: novel end product of vertebrate anaerobic metabolism. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=912182c57649da60d22ddede69c986e6Seasonal and sex-bound variation in the carbohydrate metabolism of the liver of the whitefish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=af0d758e5fddd63fee678e65e30efda1Serum cortisol levels in thermally-acclimated goldfish ( Carassius auratus ) and killifish ( Fundulus heteroclitus ): Implications in control of hepatic gl... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fb4c2d806546f115d1f4b8bd6172bdfeBreathing gas mixtures different from air: an adaptation for survival under the ice of a facultative air-breathing fish. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d4fbd3f2787dba47ed49fbf180f8a4c9JSTOR: Ecology, Vol. 63, No. 4 (Aug., 1982), pp. 1149-1166 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=88c5183a7408e726bc569400291214cf
