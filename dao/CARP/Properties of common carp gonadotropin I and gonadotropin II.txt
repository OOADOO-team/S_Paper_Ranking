name: Properties of common carp gonadotropin I and gonadotropin IIurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0016648092900055public_in: Elsevierauthors: Glen Van Der Kraak,Kunimasa Suzuki,Richard E. Peter,abstract: Two gonadotropins, GtH I and GtH II, were extracted with 35% ethanol-10% ammonium acetate, pH 6.1, from female common carp pituitary glands and purified by ion-exchange chromatography on a DE-52 column followed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-75 column. Molecular weights of GtH I and GtH II as determined by SDS-PAGE were 45,000 and 35,000, respectively. Both GtHs dissociate into two subunits following reduction with β-mercaptoethanol. These subunits contain different N-terminal amino acids (Tyr and Gly for GtH I; Tyr and Ser for GtH II). GtH I was acid stable and did not dissociate into subunits following treatment with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; GtH II readily dissociated into subunits by this treatment. GtH I and GtH II have distinct elution profiles on reverse-phase HPLC. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the β-subunit of GtH II was identical to that of common carp maturational GtH described by other workers suggesting that GtH I is a newly identified molecule. This was supported by radioimmunoassay analysis. GtH II and a common carp maturational GtH preparation (F11 cGtH; Peter et al. , 1982, J. Interdiscipl. Cycle Res. 13 , 229–239) had similar immunological activity in tests with antisera to the β-subunit of maturational GtH whereas GtH I had low (&lt;6%) cross-reactivity. GtH I, GtH II, and F11 cGtH were equipotent in tests with antisera to the α-subunit of maturational GtH suggesting these molecules contain a similar α-subunit. In vitro  bioassays using goldfish revealed that GtH I and GtH II share the same spectrum of biological activities causing stimulation of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis and induction of oocyte final maturation. The demonstration of two chemically distinct GtHs in common carp is similar to what has been described for chum and coho salmon.citations_number: 250Citation: Sex determination and sex
