name: Possible mechanisms of emphysema in smokers: cigarette smoke condensate suppresses protease inhibition in vitro.url: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM301725public_in: 万方authors: Janoff A,Carp H,abstract: To study the possible role of suppression of antiproteases by cigarette smoke in the of in smokers, the following experiments were carried out. -gels were impregnated with cigarette smoke condensate dissolved in or with the solvent alone. This procedure affected neither local pH of the gel nor subsequent physical (diffusion) of antiprotease. from various sources were then allowed to diffuse through the impregnated gels toward a counter-diffusing sample of antiprotease. The effectiveness of the antiprotease in blocking the enzyme was determined from the extent of . The substrates used included beef ligament and lung . The enzymes used were porcine pancreatic and pure . The antiproteases tested included serum, pure a1-antitrypsin, bronchopulmonary lavage fluid, and a synthetic chloromethyl inactivator of . The results showed that whole, unfractionated cigarette smoke condensate suppressed all of the antiproteases tested, except for the chloromethyl . These observations are discussed in terms of the -model of .citations_number: 424Citation: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: molecular and cellular mechanisms http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=433beb526469235895c62b6900d4a9ddHuman Plasma Proteinase Inhibitors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c626a0d1c2a75245245c4c214e080196Free-radical chemistry of cigarette smoke and its toxicological implications. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=620c73734c534d39665a8179f665bcd9Cigarette smoking, emphysema, and damage to alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a8e6d2ba2646d8c6e9d78159799eea29Elastases and emphysema.
