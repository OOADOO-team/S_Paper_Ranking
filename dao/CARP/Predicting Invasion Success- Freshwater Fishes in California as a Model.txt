name: Predicting Invasion Success: Freshwater Fishes in California as a Modelurl: http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1641/0006-3568(2006)56[515:PISFFI]2.0.CO;2public_in: BioOneauthors: Moyle, P.B,Marchetti, M.P,abstract: The location, size, and geography of California, combined with extensive knowledge of successful and failed fish invasions, provide an unusual opportunity to test predictors of invasion success. Our analyses show that different characteristics of alien fishes are important at different stages of the invasion process. We found no set of characters that predicted success for all fish invasions, although some characters increase the probability of success. The factors that best predict invasion success are (a) a history of successful establishment outside the species&#039; native range; (b) characters that promote success at multiple stages of the invasion process (e.g., high physiological tolerance); (c) invaded habitat that more or less matches the alien&#039;s native habitat; (d) high fish species richness, including other alien fishes; and (e) propagule size exceeding 100 individuals. The difficulty of predicting the invasion success of alien species points to the need to allow only introductions that have proved to be nonharmful and to take quick action to prevent the spread of new invaders.citations_number: 285Citation: Assessing the effects of climate change on aquatic invasive species http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2a721b84ac2fe189734e3e42ee937fe3Risk assessment for invasive species produces net bioeconomic benefits. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=82db723305a69becfb3f0d216d437be2Microsatellite markers identify three lineages of Phytophthora ramorum in US nurseries, yet single lineages in US forest and European nursery populations. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=123b86cc47660ae164e504c894c964e3Conservation biogeography of freshwater fishes: recent progress and future challenges. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=099e6beeac0bfca3fffd110c1f8e982fEcological impacts of nonnative freshwater fishes. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5f5d17ce714b4be8e934dc41bab97492A management framework for preventing the secondary spread of aquatic invasive species http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ed40871c2af104c80f2c6bc9455d8e80The characteristics of invasive fishes: what has been learned so far?
