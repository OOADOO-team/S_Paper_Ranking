name: In vitro suppression of serum elastase-inhibitory capacity by reactive oxygen species generated by phagocytosing polymorphonuclear leukocytes.url: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM220283public_in: 万方authors: H Carp,A Janoff,abstract: ABSTRACT  Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) phagocytosing opsonized antigen-antibody complexes, produce dialyzable species of activated oxygen which are capable of partially suppressing the elastase-inhibiting capacity (EIC) of whole human serum or purified human alpha1-proteinase inhibitor. Serum EIC was partially protially protected by superoxide dismutase, catalase, or mannitol, suggesting that hydroxyl radical, formed by interaction of superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide, might be responsible for this effect. NaN3 also partly protected EIC, implicating myeloperoxidase-mediated reactions as well. An artificial superoxide rradical-generating system, involving xanthine and xanthine-oxidase, could be substituted for phagocytosing PMN with resultant EIC suppression. These results are consistent with previous demonstrations of the release of potent oxidants by stimulated PMN, as well as earlier studies from our laboratory showing sensitivity of alpha1-proteinase inhibitor to inactivation by oxidants. Oxidative inactivation of proteinase inhibitors in the microenvironment of PMN accumulating at sites of inflammation may allow proteases released from these cells to more readily damage adjacent connective tissue structures.citations_number: 345Citation: Reactive Oxygen Species and the Central Nervous System http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f4153c1a59013f90c124cae5b1af32beHuman Plasma Proteinase Inhibitors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c626a0d1c2a75245245c4c214e080196Role of oxygen-derived free radicals and metabolites in leukocyte-dependent inflammatory reactions. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6d8ba0f7eeb02f8bbb795fe8709ed15fFree-radical chemistry of cigarette smoke and its toxicological implications. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=620c73734c534d39665a8179f665bcd9Macrophages and polymorphonuclear neutrophils in lung defense and injury http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0ec3f2fa31cf2bc96ad34cce2e98ef3dCigarette smoking, emphysema, and damage to alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a8e6d2ba2646d8c6e9d78159799eea29Tissue injury in inflammation.
