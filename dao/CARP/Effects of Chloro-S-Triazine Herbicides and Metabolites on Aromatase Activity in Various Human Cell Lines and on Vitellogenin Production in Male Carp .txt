name: Effects of Chloro-S-Triazine Herbicides and Metabolites on Aromatase Activity in Various Human Cell Lines and on Vitellogenin Production in Male Carp Hepatocytes. (Articles)url: http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/external-ref?access_num=11675267&amp;link_type=MEDpublic_in: Oxford Univ Pressauthors: Sanderson JT,Letcher RJ,Heneweer M,abstract: We investigated a potential mechanism for the estrogenic properties of three chloro-s-triazine herbicides and six metabolites in vitro in several cell systems. We determined effects on human aromatase (CYP19), the enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens, in H295R (adrenocortical carcinoma), JEG-3 (placental choriocarcinoma), and MCF-7 (breast cancer) cells; we determined effects on estrogen receptor-mediated induction of vitellogenin in primary hepatocyte cultures of adult male carp (Cyprinus carpio). In addition to atrazine, simazine, and propazine, two metabolites-atrazine-desethyl and atrazine-desisopropyl-induced aromatase activity in H295R cells concentration-dependently (0.3-30 μM) and with potencies similar to those of the parent triazines. After a 24-hr exposure to 30 μM of the triazines, an apparent maximum induction of about 2- to 2.5-fold was achieved. The induction responses were confirmed by similar increases in CYP19 mRNA levels, determined by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. In JEG-3 cells, where basal aromatase expression is about 15-fold greater than in H295R cells, the induction responses were similar but less pronounced; aromatase expression in MCF-7 cells was neither detectable nor inducible under our culture conditions. The fully dealkylated metabolite atrazine-desethyl-desisopropyl and the three hydroxylated metabolites (2-OH-atrazine-desethyl, -desisopropyl, and -desethyl-desisopropyl) did not induce aromatase activity. None of the triazine herbicides nor their metabolites induced vitellogenin production in male carp hepatocytes; nor did they antagonize the induction of vitellogenin by 100 nM ( EC50) 17β-estradiol. These findings together with other reports indicate that the estrogenic effects associated with the triazine herbicides in vivo are not estrogen receptor-mediated, but may be explained partly by their ability to induce aromatase in vitro.citations_number: 242Citation: Hermaphroditic, demasculinized frogs after exposure to the herbicide atrazine at low ecologically relevant doses http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c98b2ee6378d1c708de7586be2320b3eSynergism between trematode infection and pesticide exposure: a link to amphibian limb deformities in nature? http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c822ca96e73249837ec3318e91c01c25Atrazine-induced hermaphroditism at 0.1 ppb in American leopard frogs (Rana pipiens): laboratory and field evidence. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9449a5850dc4a4e7fbad6155589f937dHerbicides: feminization of male frogs in the wild. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=65cb3e76fe6ebc1d31a8186def64b376Induction and inhibition of aromatase (CYP19) activity by various classes of pesticides in H295R human adrenocortical carcinoma cells. - PubMed - NCBI http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=782aa4b0545090728ffde7a77e946ea6Semen quality in relation to biomarkers of pesticide exposure. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9e8c11c3247ff7d737f6ef0999529ba2Androgenic and estrogenic activity in water bodies receiving cattle feedlot effluent in Eastern Nebraska, USA. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3413e0934600b3184c0cdeef26448b6eMechanisms of estrogen signaling and gene expression via GPR30. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a61838fd6868f3c7c1268cbec90e4e9fThe Steroid Hormone Biosynthesis Pathway as a Target for Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=84001d97c7157cb0884634b2ca7440d3Nitromusk and Polycyclic Musk Compounds as Long-Term Inhibitors of Cellular Xenobiotic Defense Systems Mediated by Multidrug Transporters http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dcce8f763f0c011fcb5406c3585cbcdcReferences: Rapid colorimetric assay for cell growth and survival.
