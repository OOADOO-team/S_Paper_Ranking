name: Protein requirements of grass carp fry ( Ctenopharyngodon idella Val.)url: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0044848677900473public_in: Elsevierauthors: Konrad Dabrowski,abstract: The study was aimed at determining the optimal level of protein in a casein diet for grass carp. There was a linear relationship between the percentage of protein in the diet and the increase in fish protein and weight up to optimal levels of 41 and 43%, respectively. No further increase in fish protein or weight was noted with diets containing up to 64% of protein. However, if the optimal level was defined by the parabolic curve with the formula y = 36.21 + 6.238 x − 0.0593 x 2, it would equal 52.6 ± 1.93%. Net protein utilization (NPU) values for experimental diets were obtained using a formula which took the maintenance nitrogen metabolism on a non-protein diet into consideration. This NPU formula was related to the length of the experiment, difference in the weight of fish at the beginning of the experiment, and growth of fish fed protein diets. Both protein efficiency ratio (PER) and NPU decreased with the increase in protein content of the diets according to the formulae y = 1.966−0.018 x and y = 40.8−0.327x + 302.6 x, respectively.citations_number: 222Citation: The effects of varying dietary protein level on the growth, food conversion, protein utilization and body composition of juvenile tilapias (Sarotherodon mo... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c1aec3032dab9e9d18d687a88ba11588Proteolytic enzymes in fish development and the importance of dietary enzymes. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0091d48f85f10ec78d6261f20964f598Protein and Amino Acid Requirements http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d1fdc303ffbd5fd476bbc9caf45c5a2dProtein and Amino Acid Requirements http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=686b3a3cac11a04df40506f6d9d47b51Protein and amino acid requirements of fishes. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=99c1ce60e8a343db21befc3a752c8f1dApplication of thyroid and steroid hormones as anabolic agents in fish culture http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0d32afdd3d2a04346f5b45fd520369dfEffects of dietary protein and energy on growth, feed conversion efficiency and body composition of Tilapia aurea. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9e4aa4d45b29c44a5323dcdae9245545Development and response to a diet change of some digestive enzymes in sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) larvae http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=535fcecf96e16c91eed2117dce7daf98Effects of dietary protein level on growth performance, carcass composition and ammonia excretion in juvenile silver perch ( Bidyanus bidyanus ) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1f5b50cc959461062d5152c592c6c9d7Optimal dietary protein level for the growth of juvenile grouper, Epinephelus malabaricus , fed semipurified diets http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=90e10e1c089fc5fe070969f11a90a35fReferences: Studies on the nutrition of marine flatfish.
