name: The capacitated arc routing problem: Valid inequalities and facets.url: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1018316919294public_in: Springerauthors: Belenguer, J.M,Benavent, E,abstract: In this paper we study the polyhedron associated with the Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) where a maximum number K  of vehicles is available. We show that a subset of the facets of the CARP polyhedron depends only on the demands of the required edges and they can be derived from the study of the Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP). The conditions for a larger class of valid inequalities to define facets of the CARP polyhedron still depend on the properties of the GAP polyhedron. We introduce the special case of the CARP where all the required edges have unit demand (CARPUD) to avoid the number problem represented by the GAP. This allows us to make a polyhedral study in which the conditions for the inequalities to be facet inducing are easily verifiable. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for a variety of inequalities, which are valid for CARP, to be facet inducing for CARPUD.  The resulting partial description of the polyhedron has been used to develop a cutting plane algorithm for the Capacitated Arc Routing Problem. The lower bound provided by this algorithm outperformed all the existing lower bounds for the CARP on a set of 34 instances taken from the literature.citations_number: 175Citation: Combinatorial optimization and Green Logistics http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1c1d15f4ab1ac6a5b31bce3ca905317dA guided local search heuristic for the capacitated arc routing problem http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2bc3bc0ae427410a93687ae84812ddbaThe Capacitated Arc Routing Problem: Valid Inequalities and Facets http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dabaf3926adcfbca18ef926f2d855c20The Capacitated Arc Routing Problem: Valid Inequalities and Facets http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=414abbf3874fd20027ee7ab410d1e897A cutting plane algorithm for the capacitated arc routing problem http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b09db2f4c0ee4502f0a45f9542bbfafbCompetitive Memetic Algorithms for Arc Routing Problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=348e95d99642271a67c1bf8c4a99748dSolving capacitated arc routing problems using a transformation to the CVRP http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5198571b4fc4a203106bcc95ebcdd916Memetic algorithm with extended neighborhood search for capacitated arc routing problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1337b200011a6d4c21cdd1344dc61a58Memetic Algorithm With Extended Neighborhood Search for Capacitated Arc Routing Problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ccf6837f9859976110f68b0c4b03301bA deterministic tabu search algorithm for the capacitated arc routing problem http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6bae227e874e2e401825777e74f38bbbReferences: Integer and Combinatorial Optimization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1c080e174b025d91e290e18cecbdf925Integer and Combinatorial Optimization http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=17598566cda3189e2eba2cd195cbea99Odd Minimum Cut-Sets and b-Matchings http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e88a43616dc182d51f62f7eb65e99f1eArc Routing Problems, Part II: The Rural Postman Problem http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5dc36cf96c2577086dca491ea2a5ca23Optimization of a 532-city symmetric traveling salesman problem by branch and cut http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fac33f25cfb3492ee4c45637adf9ac30Computational experiments with algorithms for a class of routing problems http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2653eed71b79eba343a2f44902b0d1e4Arc Routing Problems, Part I: The Chinese Postman Problem http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=01dbb9382b11e85481bede0936e81c5eFacets of the Knapsack Polytope from Minimal Covers. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=720ad475689059a2d9b91b30d6d35966Arc routing problems, part I: The Chinese postman problem. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=95c69365b379ca087b35074adbcb59e3The Capacitated Arc Routing Problem: Valid Inequalities and Facets http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dabaf3926adcfbca18ef926f2d855c20The Capacitated Arc Routing Problem: Valid Inequalities and Facets http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=414abbf3874fd20027ee7ab410d1e897Polyhedral study of the capacitated vehicle routing problem http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2a71320aa37fb6e2775c41fb25c0bccdArc routing problems.
