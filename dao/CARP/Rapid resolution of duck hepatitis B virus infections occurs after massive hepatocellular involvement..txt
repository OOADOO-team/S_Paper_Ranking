First, to better characterize chronic infection, Pekin ducks, congenitally infected with the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), were used to assess age-dependent variations in viremia, percentage of DHBV-infected hepatocytes, and average levels of DNA replication intermediates in the cytoplasm and of covalently closed circular DNA in the nuclei of infected hepatocytes. Levels of viremia and viral DNA were found to peak at about the time of hatching but persisted at relatively constant levels in chronically infected birds up to 2 years of age. The percentage of infected hepatocytes was also constant, with DHBV replication in virtually 100% of hepatocytes in all birds. Next, we found that adolescent ducks inoculated intravenously with a large dose of DHBV also developed massive infection of hepatocytes with an early but low-level viremia, followed by rapid development of a neutralizing antibody response. No obvious quantitative or qualitative differences between transiently and chronically infected liver tissue were detected in the intracellular markers of viral replication examined. However, in the adolescent duck experiment, DHBV infection was rapidly cleared from the liver even when up to 80% of hepatocytes were initially infected. In all of these ducks, clearance of infection was accompanied by only a mild hepatitis, with no evidence that massive cell death contributed to the clearance. This finding suggested that mechanisms in addition to immune-mediated destruction of hepatocytes might make major contributions to clearance of infections, including physiological turnover of hepatocytes in the presence of a neutralizing antibody response and/or spontaneous loss of the capacity of hepatocytes to support virus replication.citations_number: 241Citation: Hepatitis B Virus Immunopathogenesis http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e939d36c005fe54a67af286d5ff1a499MAP3K-related kinase involved in NF-kappaB induction by TNF, CD95 and IL-1. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6a97c44c856a2b2c6a6da6b976b3d25bViral Clearance Without Destruction of Infected Cells During Acute HBV Infection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=417593791f037cc1d30461bd824f229aIL-22 increases the innate immunity of tissues. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=50743d5a20e5a8223b41667d46dcd116Intracellular inactivation of the hepatitis B virus by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9a124dd98d71306222606de21bbd4f52Site-specific phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha by a novel ubiquitination-dependent protein kinase activity. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=62a531ab3bdd31847791f84c60684892IL-22 Inhibits Epidermal Differentiation and Induces Proinflammatory Gene Expression and Migration of Human Keratinocytes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=10c110512fb19da5c149129288112487CD8+ T Cells Mediate Viral Clearance and Disease Pathogenesis during Acute Hepatitis B Virus Infection http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fa2f17c079e518a30b64ef33ec12f0ebIL-22 but not IL-17 provides protection to hepatocytes during acute liver inflammation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3720ee035862e128ff77a8ef97bb16bfMechanisms of class I restricted immunopathology.
