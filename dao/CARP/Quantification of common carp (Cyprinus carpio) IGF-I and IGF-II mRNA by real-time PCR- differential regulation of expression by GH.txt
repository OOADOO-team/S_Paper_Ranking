name: Quantification of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) IGF-I and IGF-II mRNA by real-time PCR: differential regulation of expression by GHurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM12967342public_in: 万方authors: Q P Vong,K M Chan,C H K Cheng,abstract: Abstract IGFs are potent mitogens for many different cell types and play important roles in growth and development. A multitude of regulatory factors modulate the expression of IGFs. In some teleosts, liver IGF-I expression has been demonstrated to depend on the presence of GH. However, the GH dependence of IGF-II expression in teleosts is controversial. Moreover, most IGF expression studies in bony fish have been focused on the liver, and information on extrahepatic tIssues are conflicting and inconsistent. This is partly due to the fact that the traditional methods of mRNA measurement such as Northern blot and RT-PCR are not sensitive enough to detect changes in IGF levels in extrahepatic tIssues because of the low levels of IGFs in these tIssues. In addition, there have been few studies on the IGF system of non-salmonid teleosts. Our laboratory has thus begun such studies on a local tropical fast-growing fish, the common carp (Cyprinus carpio). In this study, real-time quantitative PCR assays were developed for the accurate measurement of IGF-I and IGF-II mRNA levels in common carp tIssues. This quantitative method was based on the measurement of a fluorescent labeled probe, which was cleaved by Taq polymerase during PCR by the 5&#039;--&gt;3&#039; nuclease activity. The signal generated was directly proportional to the starting copy number of the target molecules in the sample. Hence, it was possible to detect and quantify the mRNA levels of both IGF-I and IGF-II reliably in very small amounts of tIssues obtained from juvenile common carp. Using these assays, the expression pattern of IGF-I and IGF-II in various common carp tIssues was studied, and their differential response to GH stimulation was also investigated.citations_number: 135Citation: Insulin-like growth factor signaling in fish. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5fa0c1ee04da19c87f203719dce59819Growth hormone and insulin-like growth factors in fish: Where we are and where to go http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e8151ac19b3e9df3ac1e86325904059cTime course analysis of gene expression during light-induced photoreceptor cell death and regeneration in albino zebrafish. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5d5495cae963e92b3ae5f419627ec7baEstablishment of a real-time RT-PCR for the determination of absolute amounts of IGF-I and IGF-II gene expression in liver and extrahepatic sites of the ti... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=52c71bca849ca658927587320b936183Influences of the environment on the endocrine and paracrine fish growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor-I system. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b3c5f475078cf98909afb7e0111071e9IGF-I and IGF-II mRNA expression in slow and fast growing families of USDA103 channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bab3e7cd2d3bf071e9e6d0b6d32d4766Characterization and regulation of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) ovary. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ec317d1e458cd1dc755c24d4674c652cFeedback regulation of growth hormone synthesis and secretion in fish and the emerging concept of intrapituitary feedback loop \u2606 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9888b8f2f25b6cad8eb9a4b10f6a23e2Gender-specific expression of multiple estrogen receptors, growth hormone receptors, insulin-like growth factors and vitellogenins, and effects of 17\u03b2-est... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8cb9647f6bbfc6522d3bc20be0c224c3Effects of exogenous cortisol on the GH\/IGF-I\/IGFBP network in channel catfish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4d1288d6f5e66add1ac7a276aa024915References: Insulin-Like Growth Factors I and II.
