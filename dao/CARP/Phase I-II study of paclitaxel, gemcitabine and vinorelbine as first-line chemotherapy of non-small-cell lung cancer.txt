name: Phase I/II study of paclitaxel, gemcitabine and vinorelbine as first-line chemotherapy of non-small-cell lung cancerurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM10637256public_in: 万方authors: Lorusso, V.,abstract: Background: The aim of our study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel combined with a fixed dose of gemcitabine and vinorelbine in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to evaluate in a phase 11 trial the efficacy of this combination. Patients and methods: Sixty-two patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were treated with paclitaxel in escalating doses from 40-80 mg/m(2) combined with gemcitabine and vinorelbine at fixed doses of 1000 mg/m(2) and 25 mg/m(2), respectively. All drugs were given intravenously on day I and 8 every 3 weeks. Results: In a phase I trial, carried out on 21 patients, grade 4 neutropenia, as dose-limiting toxicity, occurred at the dosage level of paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2). In a phase II trial, with paclitaxel administered at 70 mg/m(2), 27 out of 41 (66%) assessable patients responded (10% complete responses and 56% partial responses). Objective response was observed in 13 of 16 patients (81%) with stage IIIB disease and in 14 of 25 (56%) with stage IV disease. The median time to treatment failure was 26 weeks (range 3-72 weeks; 32 weeks and 20 weeks for stages 11113 and IV, respectively) and median survival 62 weeks (range 4-176 weeks; 72 weeks and 56 weeks for stages IIIB and IV, respectively). One-year survival was 64% for all patients (72% for patients with stage IIIB and 52% for those with stage IV). Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia were observed in 11 (27%) and seven (17%) cases, respectively; grade 3 thrombocytopenia was observed in three. patients (7%) and grade 3 anemia in four patients (10%). The most relevant non-hematological toxicity was grade 2/3 asthenia, which was observed in 12 patients (29%). Alopecia was almost universal, whereas nausea and vomiting were absent. Conclusions: The combination of paclitaxel, gemcitabine and vinorelbine is effective and tolerable in the treatment of NSCLC. The high activity and low toxicity of this regimen warrant randomized studies with platinum-containing combinations.citations_number: 298Citation: American Society of Clinical Oncology treatment of unresectable non-small-cell lung cancer guideline: update 2003. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fdbc2d9c918ec4216a0d2cf602f5a8b1Cisplatin-based therapy for elderly patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: implications of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 5592, a randomize... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=34b8e740231195d633bcf4826eafbfbfUse of positron emission tomography for response assessment of lymphoma: consensus of the Imaging Subcommittee of International Harmonization Project in Ly... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=79ab182142c3bd1f681947f0d8d529e0Brentuximab Vedotin (SGN-35) for Relapsed CD30-Positive Lymphomas http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=99f9a18ed090ae656d1c455d32ccf69cChemotherapy for Elderly Patients With Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: The Multicenter Italian Lung Cancer in the Elderly Study (MILES) Phase III Rand... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2de75b9ae003045aa5e4ad6c8f2bd4e6Gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (GVD), a salvage regimen in relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma: CALGB 59804 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=75ba8b9e3c0e30e8950250486772344dComprehensive geriatric assessment for older patients with cancer. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3a5464e44b459edf71dcc3889739e927Benefits of adding a drug to a single-agent or a 2-agent chemotherapy regimen in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a meta-analysis. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bd9ffd14414e95491411dadecbfe645ePhase III study of docetaxel compared with vinorelbine in elderly patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: results of the West Japan Thoracic Onc... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2aa56c9aaf599af609199f132181afecOutcomes for elderly, advanced-stage non small-cell lung cancer patients treated with bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel: analysis ... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=39b9a2efcbb3a0efeb2cecfbd2479f2dReferences: 2000 update of recommendations for the use of hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors: evidence-based, clinical practice guidelines.
