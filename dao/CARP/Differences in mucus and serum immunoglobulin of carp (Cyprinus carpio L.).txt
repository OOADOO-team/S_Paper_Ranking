name: Differences in mucus and serum immunoglobulin of carp (Cyprinus carpio L.)url: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0145305X93900039public_in: Elsevierauthors: Jan H.W.M. Rombout,Nico Taverne,Margot van de Kamp,abstract: Electrophoretic analysis did not reveal clear differences between skin mucus and serum immunoglobulin (Ig) of carp. The majority of both Igs were tetrameric (Â±760 kDa) and composed of 25 kDa light (L) chains and 70 kDa heavy (H) chains, but dimeric and monomeric forms were found as well. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) WCI 12 produced from serum Ig appeared to react with the H chain of both molecules. After immunisation of mice with purified mucus Ig, mAbs could be selected that were reactive with mucus Ig only. Two of these mAbs (WCI M1 and WCI M2) were immunoreactive with the H chain of mucus Ig and not or hardly immunoreactive with the H chain of serum Ig, indicating differences in the composition of the H chains of both molecules. Because WCI M2 appeared to recognize a carbohydrate determinant, differences seem to occur in the protein as well as carbohydrate composition of mucus and serum Ig. Flow cytometric results showed that both mAbs were reactive with the same subpopulation of WCI 12-positive B cells. Immunohistochemical reactions on cryosections also showed a limited reaction by these mAbs compared with WCI 12; only epithelium of skin and bile ducts and capillaries in the liver were strongly positive with these mAbs. The presence of mucus Ig at these locations is discussed. Our results indicate structural and functional differences between mucus and serum Ig, which may explain the mucosal immune responses reported for fish. Such a specific mucosal defense system can be very important for fish, living in a pathogenrich environment.citations_number: 264Citation: Innate immunity of fish (overview). http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c3a47d9f2bded858e78c6809fbd77482Immunity to bacteria in fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=faa81fe3a0f58e71636d1f9d3b1c7199Probiotics and immunity: a fish perspective http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=490f510ad164842b7a3367b1d777a2deBacterial Interactions in Early Life Stages of Marine Cold Water Fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=151b0fec11c0ca1f5de1156df370b71fIgT, a primitive immunoglobulin class specialized in mucosal immunity http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=29ccaa712e2f9b4cadfc6bf7ae3d2dbfOntogeny of the immune system of fish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=69b21a2a1452a308ba9d8a93df2f0e9cNon\u2010specific defence mechanisms in fish, with particular reference to the reticuloendothelial system (RES) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3bb803a2ba417f871fdba767036d95dbDifferences in mucus and serum immunoglobulin of carp ( Cyprinus carpio L.) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a2b0077639b01ec684f41fa84873b3fdThe intestines of carnivorous fish: structure and functions and the relations with diet. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9777c941ad409dedd347c1843b69a529Teleost intestinal immunology http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=204538da1bc7c559e820e4db4fba9fb3References: Differences in mucus and serum immunoglobulin of carp ( Cyprinus carpio L.) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a2b0077639b01ec684f41fa84873b3fdThe gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) of carp (Cyprinus carpio L.): an immunocytochemical analysis. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=86f4d90c997b333a0218cd80818505e8Immunological importance of the second gut segment of carp.
