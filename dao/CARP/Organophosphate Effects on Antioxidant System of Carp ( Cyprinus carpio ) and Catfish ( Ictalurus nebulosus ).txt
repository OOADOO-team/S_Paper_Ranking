name: Organophosphate Effects on Antioxidant System of Carp ( Cyprinus carpio ) and Catfish ( Ictalurus nebulosus )url: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0742841396002344public_in: Elsevierauthors: Hai D.Q,Varga S.I,Matkovics B,abstract: Abstract The effect of the organophosphate insecticide Dichlorvos on antioxidant enzymes and other oxidative and redox parameters of carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) and catfish (Ictalurus nebulosus) were studied. Changes in superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and in the case of carp acetylcholinesterase activities were studied in tissue homogenates. Other parameters studied: changes of lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione and the amounts of two radicals, superoxide and hydroxyl radicals are compared. Our results showed that the organophosphate tested, besides its inhibitory effect on acetylcholinesterase--or together with it--induces changes characteristic of &quot;oxidative stress.&quot;citations_number: 205Citation: Environmentally induced oxidative stress in aquatic animals http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f1ab522b72f297bb329a1e0eec760b7fGlutathione S-transferases as antioxidant defence agents confer pyrethroid resistance in Nilaparvata lugens. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6287d0726bb8b77f8ce23772d7c04197Antioxidant Defenses in Fish: Biotic and Abiotic Factors http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=543571a32acd3804ccacaf98d5675c13Variation of antioxidant enzyme activities of sprat (Sprattus sprattus) larvae and organic contaminant levels in mixed zooplankton from the southern North ... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cd0bfad4db0727b6bb6bf5415db61303Oxidative stress and antioxidant defenses in goldfish Carassius auratus during anoxia and reoxygenation. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=16e73c4b70bc1f44e2df5a4331e513d5Induction of hepatic antioxidants in freshwater catfish ( Channa punctatus Bloch) is a biomarker of paper mill effluent exposure http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=521e30e6d8b5ef114bc588fbeeaf03b3Molecular biomarkers of oxidative stress in aquatic organisms in relation to toxic environmental pollutants. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5adf8c4d77792952f4607b60115ba230Tissue-specific oxidative stress responses in fish exposed to 2,4-D and azinphosmethyl http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d85eb78a44cabb1895d557a256918c92Integrated use of biomarkers (acetylcholinesterase and antioxidant enzymes activities) in Mytilus galloprovincialis and Mullus barbatus in an Italian coast... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=824ad70a367e27de3a255d0293660555Fish tolerance to organophosphate-induced oxidative stress is dependent on the glutathione metabolism and enhanced by N -acetylcysteine http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bdf2399f9f9987dc0c71da55c6bb4dbfReferences: Purification and properties of rat lung soluble glutathione peroxidase. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=036f087ab8cf0813e59b7cb59fad3f3bHydroxyl-radical-induced iron-catalysed degradation of 2-deoxyribose.
