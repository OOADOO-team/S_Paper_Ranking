Tiku,A.Y. Gracey,A.I. Macartney,abstract: Abstract Poikilothermic animals respond to chronic cold by increasing phosphoglyceride unsaturation to restore the fluidity of cold-rigidified membranes. Despite the importance of this compensatory response, the enzymes involved have not been clearly identified, and the mechanisms that control their activity are unknown. In carp liver, cold induces an 8- to 10-fold increase in specific activity of the microsomal stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase. Cold-induced up-regulation of gene transcription resulted in a 10-fold increase in desaturase transcript amounts after 48 to 60 hours. However, this increase was preceded by the activation of latent desaturase, probably by a posttranslational mechanism. These two mechanisms may act sequentially to match desaturase expression to the demands imposed by a progressive decrease in temperature.citations_number: 127Citation: Climate variations and the physiological basis of temperature dependent biogeography: systemic to molecular hierarchy of thermal tolerance in animals. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=15d8668b2baac4422e75d1f545bfa7e3Membrane fluidity and its roles in the perception of environmental signals http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=03da99281f47928f64505d782410a220Adaptation and acclimation of photosynthetic microorganisms to permanently cold environments. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=888660b1a150b8999ab4d44b4b6f3958Recent insights into stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b35d9bc63eea0cbc208634a0ab7b1bc5Molecular analysis of acclimation to cold http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b0f3f7b31edf12c9aa2cacb193e0595The Role of Lipid Physical Properties in Lipid Barriers http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4aa9f6b6535363500a5412d6a03182dbEnvironmental and dietary influences on highly unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and expression of fatty acyl desaturase and elongase genes in liver of A... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=49ca4bb03130e4956a9c9330de4fa3afThe pathway for perception and transduction of low-temperature signals in Synechocystis. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=67f29da13033ccd796b3bab09acdb236Lipid compositional correlates of temperature-adaptive interspecific differences in membrane physical structure http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=62a00dc426f1887e6dd683ce00c44f13Effects of water temperature and diets containing palm oil on fatty acid desaturation and oxidation in hepatocytes and intestinal enterocytes of rainbow tr... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7f8035938b1b07be6706fc1f3475233eReferences: Single step method of RNA isolation by Acid Guanidium Thiocyanate-Phenol-Chloroform Extraction http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bd09717cb92a6fb6b0b6df62b3bc44adVariable homeoviscous responses of different brain membranes of thermally-acclimated goldfish http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=361c2edb69436b91d7ca0ea6e836c8c7Isolation and characterization of \u03b2-act in gene of carp (Cyprinus carpio) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9bb08ef77a07c3ecb385eef6e6b4f8c8Cold-induced increase of \u03b4 9 - and \u03b4 6 -desaturase activities in endoplasmic membranes of carp liver http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9f400213e9436cdac26f437bb0bef603
