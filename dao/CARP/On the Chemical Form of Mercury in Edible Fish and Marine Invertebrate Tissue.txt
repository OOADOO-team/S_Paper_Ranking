name: On the Chemical Form of Mercury in Edible Fish and Marine Invertebrate Tissueurl: http://www.tandfonline.com/servlet/linkout?suffix=i1548-8667-22-4-280-Bloom1&amp;dbid=16&amp;doi=10.1577%2FH10-005.1&amp;key=10.1139%2Ff92-113public_in: Taylor & Francisauthors: Nicolas S. Bloom,abstract: Abstract Total mercury, monomethylmercury (CH3Hg), and dimethylmercury ((CH3)2Hg) in edible muscle were examined in 229 samples, representing seven freshwater and eight saltwater fish species and several species of marine invertebrates using ultraclean techniques. Total mercury was determined by hot HNO3/H2SO4/BrCl digestion, SnCl2 reduction, purging onto gold, and analysis by cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVAFS). Methylmercury was determined by KOH/methanol digestion using aqueous phase ethylation, cryogenic gas chromatography, and CVAFS detection. Total mercury and CH3Hg concentrations varied from 0.011 to 2.78-mu-g.g-1 (wet weight basis, as Hg) for all samples, while no sample contained detectable (CH3)2Hg ( 95%) of the mercury present is as CH3Hg and that past reports of substantially lower CH3Hg fractions may have been biased by analytical and homogeneity variability.citations_number: 950Citation: Mercury in the Aquatic Environment: A Review of Factors Affecting Methylation http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=36f32ac9ed50efb99fb19f0b28425a51Ecotoxicology of organotin compounds. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c3fa44960154f9764f5a0a21a6efce27Effects of prenatal and postnatal methylmercury exposure from fish consumption on neurodevelopment: outcomes at 66 months of age in the Seychelles Child De... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ca5c16d363022d6cd995d190017ae7ebMarine biogeochemical cycling of mercury http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=49a77034b58673176d4f4015fb4a7ffaBioaccumulation of mercury in pelagic freshwater food webs http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c11e9250f98576756a7f075d91e0fc01Revisiting the Classics: Considering Nonconsumptive Effects in Textbook Examples of Predator\u2014Prey Interactions http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f9d8eda3e75dede5f98d85a9653e7d47Bioaccumulation of mercury and methylmercury http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=445138012c4d87f90cdec7c5507f77b6Blood organic mercury and dietary mercury intake: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999 and 2000 http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=af53c2b7fd0dd5ad09d432f72828c57cSelenocompounds in Plants and Animals and their Biological Significance http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b10d10aa6e63530f3bb9af81fc5d7ce7Methylmercury Exposure Biomarkers as Indicators of Neurotoxicity in Children Aged 7 Years http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6105b188a93c2c121039e523456f412aReferences: Determination of mercury in seawater at sub-nanogram per liter levels http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d3472d2f6d0951a9596d14342f49e026Determination of methylmercury compounds in foodstuffs.
