name: The Muscle Ankyrin Repeat Proteins: CARP, ankrd2/Arpp and DARP as a Family of Titin Filament-based Stress Response Moleculesurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_JJ024004270public_in: 万方authors: Melanie K. Miller, Marie-Louise Bang, Christian C. Witt,abstract: CARP, ankrd-2/Arpp, and DARP, are three members of a conserved gene family, referred to here as MARPs (muscle ankyrin repeat proteins). The expression of MARPs is induced upon injury and hypertrophy (CARP), stretch or denervation (ankrd2/Arpp), and during recovery following starvation (DARP), suggesting that they are involved in muscle stress response pathways. Here, we show that MARP family members contain within their ankyrin repeat region a binding site for the myofibrillar elastic protein titin. Within the myofibril, MARPs, myopalladin, and the calpain protease p94 appear to be components of a titin N2A-based signaling complex. Ultrastructural studies demonstrated that all three endogenous MARP proteins co-localize with I-band titin N2A epitopes in adult heart muscle tissues. In cultured fetal rat cardiac myocytes, passive stretch induced differential distribution patterns of CARP and DARP: staining for both proteins was increased in the nucleus and at the I-band region of myofibrils, while DARP staining also increased at intercalated discs. We speculate that the myofibrillar MARPs are regulated by stretch, and that this links titin-N2A-based myofibrillar stress/strain signals to a MARP-based regulation of muscle gene expression.citations_number: 304Citation: The ankyrin repeat as molecular architecture for protein recognition http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=34ce58df9362656843a680321c3d219cThe Kinase Domain of Titin Controls Muscle Gene Expression and Protein Turnover http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cddf1624e0d827fe19846fb1ae5f2612Truncations of Titin Causing Dilated Cardiomyopathy | NEJM http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=55d6ae3d0d9406e2679e7726511e495eAltered titin expression, myocardial stiffness, and left ventricular function in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=db8ff1020599b8cd0abeb2f4ddb687fbThe giant protein titin: a major player in myocardial mechanics, signaling, and disease http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ac0f3c3eb89bde3c5089c09b6e8e592aCardiac Hypertrophy and Reduced Contractility in Hearts Deficient in the Titin Kinase Region http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0efd8bc8fc6f34673f559f6d45fef0e1Muscle ring finger 1, but not muscle ring finger 2, regulates cardiac hypertrophy in vivo http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fae9881c711cc751331e3f8cf2e198d5A mutation in the human phospholamban gene, deleting arginine 14, results in lethal, hereditary cardiomyopathy. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1b68dbc4d71dca98ee5e0500e7ae0befSense and stretchability: the role of titin and titin-associated proteins in myocardial stress-sensing and mechanical dysfunction. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3ad4bd8ba1dfba62db59121baed50a49Mechanical stress-strain sensors embedded in cardiac cytoskeleton: Z disk, titin, and associated structures. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b7b24aff9f804d2b0a154841db5937a5References: Autocrine release of angiotensin II mediates stretch-induced hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes in vitro. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=812122a509ba21691eb6d7db20f6caecTitins: giant proteins in charge of muscle ultrastructure and elasticity. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e8576da3f9683b44a03af04a26d427c3THE CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR RESPONSE OF CARDIAC MYOCYTES TO MECHANICAL STRESS http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7ac6f418e1958afc0b998bea2d07bde0Mechanotransduction in stretch-induced hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4946669c797f755b484beeb30186a212The cardiac mechanical stretch sensor machinery involves a Z disc complex that is defective in a subset of human dilated cardiomyopathy. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fde6884a5f10662200f83e92e1576f72Mechanical stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy: mechanisms and signal transduction pathways http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c675bb9992406a4a0d1f1630f12608b7The Complete Gene Sequence of Titin, Expression of an Unusual \u2248700-kDa Titin Isoform, and Its Interaction With Obscurin Identify a Novel Z-Line to I-Band ... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6fc077de2a5d026b8907ec5e0d0b9ab7Striated muscle cytoarchitecture: an intricate web of form and function http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=34e1b463d4e1b163b5681b9103de54c3Signalling pathways that mediate skeletal muscle hypertrophy and atrophy http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=58e8b9f4336f2551a1e4072fd10e389eA novel ligand for CD44 is serglycin, a hematopoietic cell lineage-specific proteoglycan.
