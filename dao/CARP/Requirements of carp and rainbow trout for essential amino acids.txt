name: Requirements of carp and rainbow trout for essential amino acidsurl: http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/19801414348.htmlpublic_in: CAB Directauthors: OGINO,Chinkichi,abstract: The requirements of carp and rainbow trout for essential amino acids (EAA) were estimated from the daily increase of each EAA in the body when the fish were fed on the diets with proteins of high biological value. There was no distinct difference in the EAA requirements between carp and rainbow trout. The contents of EAA in the dietary proteins needed to satisfy the requirements of carp and rai...citations_number: 181Citation: Protein and Amino Acid Requirements http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d1fdc303ffbd5fd476bbc9caf45c5a2dProtein and Amino Acid Requirements http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=686b3a3cac11a04df40506f6d9d47b51Total sulfur amino acid requirement of juvenile red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9c472cc1bd440d5b3f8851f3b46f03b5Response of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) to supplements of individual essential amino acids in a semipurified diet, including an estimate of the mai... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e7431460decaf3079a8e07c88ac1037dQuantitative essential amino acid requirements for growth of catla, Catla catla (Hamilton) http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e4b4d2b1f335569b690cdefc92179e35Protein and amino acid requirements: A critique of methods http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b92a20c1e414f7d63a47c5bae5eea347Dietary requirements of rainbow trout for tryptophan, lysine and arginine determined by growth and biochemical measurements. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=40f7069b31ece812a4ce9689c20af8e7Investigations into the requirements of the Tilapia Sarotherodon mossambicus for dietary methionine, lysine and arginine in semi-synthetic diets. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e1f922d7316c2de616127c35c29cc364Plant protein ingredients with lysine supplementation reduce dietary protein level in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) diets, and reduce ammonia nitroge... http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0e120101a2c87eb2bd799752123318b7Effect of culture system on the nutrition and growth performance of Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei (Boone) fed different diets http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=18a1d9151ebd7ebdf3d3d7c1c206de01References:
