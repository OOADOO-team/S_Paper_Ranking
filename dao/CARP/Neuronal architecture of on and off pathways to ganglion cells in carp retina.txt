name: Neuronal architecture of on and off pathways to ganglion cells in carp retinaurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM73223public_in: 万方authors: Famiglietti, E., Kaneko, A, Tachibana, M,abstract: Bipolar, amacrine, and ganglion cells of carp retina, stained intracellularly with Procion yellow, can be divided into types a and b, according to the destination of terminals and dendritic trees in the inner plexiform layer (sublamina a and b, respectively). Type a cells showed hyperpolarizing, or off, responses and type b cells depolarizing, or on, responses. Carp thus resembles cat in the basic organization of on and off pathways in the retina.citations_number: 521Citation: Clustered intrinsic connections in cat visual cortex. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=de324894624127b1578a2bf25c9c9b7aAmacrine cells, bipolar cells and ganglion cells of the cat retina: A Golgi study http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=65917021dbe33290ea93cffda4df3d30Localization of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor in synaptic terminals in the vertebrate retina http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ddcf6a1fd89b4d560fd347221f0b70e4'Starburst' amacrine cells and cholinergic neurons: mirror-symmetric on and off amacrine cells of rabbit retina. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1fdbc240401c2a5e071f7ff94f48aa98Retinal Ganglion Cells: A Functional Interpretation of Dendritic Morphology http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7b8f8f09f0e63cf9610677a445ddeb16Origins of crossed and uncrossed retinal projections in pigmented and albino mice. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e5872426abf5321efa6db2b4642638caThe ON and OFF channels of the visual system. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a010e6f517f1e7759a4aabc3030fabf2Neural circuitry of the cat retina: cone pathways to ganglion cells http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e1deccefc64e2e10b0687d69833a3c46Membrane and synaptic properties of identified neurons in the olfactory bulb http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dc2ebe3f0f3c6d031fb357a78b14adceMorphologies of rabbit retinal ganglion cells with concentric receptive fields. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=787a21fb1983712dd840e0afbb39387cReferences: Physiological and morphological identification of horizontal, bipolar and amacrine cells in goldfish retina http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7965195995d3e3922bd657b55cc39571Structural basis for ON-and OFF-center responses in retinal ganglion cells http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ea1dd37f13f25fe229c13e5139c4b22aReceptive field organization of bipolar and amacrine cells in the goldfish retina http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2cd04f5fa095549e9528dd725d55d88cColour receptors, and their synaptic connexions, in the retina of a cyprinid fish. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=920e901a7389c61eb6b86478add52dbdColour-coded ganglion cells in the goldfish retina: extension of their receptive fields by means of new stimuli. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=997e01f4bce9b294b57a79cd678cff44Functional organization of catfish retina http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9bd5d67b8203aee2c01cd868285df20aIdentification of amacrine and ganglion cells in the carp retina. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=070e12233434b42893458828153b48bdA photosensitive pigment of the carp retina http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f31b0753518546f472e8379fa2b69f63Unusual units in the goldfish optic nerve http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a15cd06c483e557077ae296239bf712eStructural basis for on-and off-center responses in retinal bipolar cells http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=55f85a0d27816eb714c91ad572d9fdc4
