name: Mouse polyclonal and monoclonal antibody to scrapie-associated fibril proteinsurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM2446004public_in: 万方authors: R J Kascsak,R Rubenstein,PA Merz,abstract: Antibody response in mice to scrapie-associated fibril proteins (protease-resistant proteins [PrPs]) was generated to different epitopes depending on the source of antigen. Mice responded differently to PrPs isolated from scrapie-infected animals of homologous (mouse) versus heterologous (hamster) species. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay established to monitor this antibody response in mice immunized with PrPs was unable to detect such a response in scrapie-infected mice. A monoclonal antibody (MAb), 263K 3F4, derived from a mouse immunized with hamster 263K PrPs reacted with hamster but not mouse PrPs. MAb 263K 3F4 also recognized normal host protein of 33 to 35 kilodaltons in brain tissue from hamsters and humans but not from bovine, mouse, rat, sheep, or rabbit brains. This is the first demonstration of epitope differences on this host protein in different species. The defining of various epitopes on PrP through the use of MAbs will lead to a better understanding of the relationship of PrPs to their host precursor protein and to the infectious scrapie agent.citations_number: 955Citation: \u03b1-Synuclein in filamentous inclusions of Lewy bodies from Parkinson\u2019s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=053b2d090a45bf309c7277a0720d7458Conversion of alpha-helices into beta-sheets features in the formation of the scrapie prion proteins. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=17b36d19f78c5fc289bdd0a9b76f0eb3Eight prion strains have PrPSc molecules with differentconformations http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9ea4b9890bb549ff7894e3779c7d0080Prions. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=aee7be9e557d0677d1336629aca66ea8Human spongiform encephalopathy: The national institutes of health series of 300 cases of experimentally transmitted disease http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cead0ab86d8a86d06943e9a33ad6d212Molecular basis of phenotypic variability in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e0827b848eef8e345d7be11a0bd7a2eeSensitive detection of pathological prion protein by cyclic amplification of protein misfolding. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=970ed9303555c3bdf264ae8e8677a680Prion propagation in mice expressing human and chimeric PrP transgenes implicates the interaction of cellular PrP with another protein. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=87b200ad9824b9273343c283efd020a9Secondary structure analysis of the scrapie-associated protein PrP 27-30 in water by infrared spectroscopy. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=845232b567b4711e298f1c99746f2120Evidence for the Conformation of the Pathologic Isoform of the Prion Protein Enciphering and Propagating Prion Diversity http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9ec8f855dc225fd9c419b483e46a5d76References: Mouse polyclonal and monoclonal antibody to scrapie-associated fibril proteins. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=09a4fc4e37fe3b40a5c74d2c4693f207Scrapie and cellular PrP isoforms are encoded by the same chromosomal gene http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ea780701e149271dbe480e9d69502d36Separation and properties of cellular and scrapie prion proteins. http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3f75fdfb492b5ca743e8b112296a1757The nasal provocation test in the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis.
