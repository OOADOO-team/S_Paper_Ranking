name: Saddlepoint approximation of random-coding boundsurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/224227952_Saddlepoint_approximation_of_random-coding_boundspublic_in: Information Theory &amp; Applications Workshopauthors: Martinez, Alfonso,Guillén I Fàbregas, Albert,abstract: This paper considers random-coding bounds to the decoding error probability with maximum-metric mismatched decoders. Their error exponents are determined and the saddle-point approximation to the corresponding probability is derived. This approximation is accurate and allows for simple numerical evaluation, as verified for several channels of interest.citations_number: 21Citation: On the Dispersions of Three Network Information Theory Problems "Vincent Y.
