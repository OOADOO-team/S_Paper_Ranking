name: Testing Randomness by Means of Random Matrix Theoryurl: http://ptps.oxfordjournals.org/content/194/73public_in: 《Progress of Theoretical Physics Supplement》authors: Xin Yang,Ryota Itoi,Mieko Tanaka-Yamawaki,abstract: Random matrix theory (RMT) derives, at the limit of both the dimension N and the length of sequences L going to infinity, that the eigenvalue distribution of the cross correlation matrix with high random nature can be expressed by one function of Q = L/N. Using this fact, we propose a new method of testing randomness of a given sequence. Namely, a sequence passes the test if the eigenvalue distribution of the cross correlation matrix made of the pieces of a given sequence matches the corresponding theoretical curve derived by RMT, and fails otherwise. The comparison is quantified by employing the moments of the eigenvalue distribution to its theoretical counterparts. We have tested its performance on five kinds of test data including the Linear Congruential Generator (LCG), the Mersenne Twister (MT), and three physical random number generators, and confirmed that all the five pass the test. However, the method can distinguish the difference of randomness of the derivatives of random sequences, and the initial part of LCG, which are distinctly less random than the original sequences.citations_number: 6Citation: Moment Approach for Quantitative Evaluation of Randomness Based on RMT Formula "Mieko Tanaka-Yamawaki" "Xin Yang" "Ryota Itoi" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=beefff8b9165e4e4b135fa5c4820c436Predicting the Security Levels of Stock Investment by Using the RMT-test ☆ "Xin Yang" "Yuuta Mikamori" "Mieko Tanaka-Yamawaki" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4e333e3b36103a468ca8c400a23dc8eeVerification of the Relationship Between the Stock Performance and the Randomness of Price Fluctuation ☆ "Mieko Tanaka-Yamawaki" "XinYang" "Yuuta Mikamori" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=40a25af96283704ba414cb8aaea4363bRandomness Criteria of the RMT-test Compared to the NIST ☆ "Yuuta Mikamori" "Xin Yang" "Ryota Itoi" "Mieko Tanaka-Yamawaki" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fa9b31778dd9cc0285d114848d8383d9Extracting Market Trends from the Cross Correlation between Stock Time Series "Mieko Tanaka-Yamawaki" "X.
