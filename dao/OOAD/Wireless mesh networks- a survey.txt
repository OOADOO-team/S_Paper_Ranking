name: Wireless mesh networks: a surveyurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128604003457public_in: Computer Networksauthors: Ian F. Akyildiz, Xudong Wang, Weilin Wang,abstract: Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) consist of mesh routers and mesh  clients, where mesh routers have minimal mobility and form the backbone of WMNs. They provide network access for both mesh and conventional clients. The integration of WMNs with other networks such as the Internet, cellular, IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.15, IEEE 802.16, sensor networks, etc., can be accomplished through the gateway and bridging functions in the mesh routers. Mesh clients can be either stationary or mobile, and can form a client mesh network among themselves and with mesh routers. WMNs are anticipated to resolve the limitations and to significantly improve the performance of ad hoc networks, wireless local  area networks (WLANs), wireless personal area networks (WPANs), and  wireless metropolitan area networks (WMANs). They are undergoing rapid  progress and inspiring numerous deployments. WMNs will deliver wireless  services for a large variety of applications in personal, local, campus,  and metropolitan areas. Despite recent advances in wireless mesh  networking, many research challenges remain in all protocol layers. This  paper presents a detailed study on recent advances and open research  issues in WMNs. System architectures and applications of WMNs are  described, followed by discussing the critical factors influencing  protocol design. Theoretical network capacity and the state-of-the-art  protocols for WMNs are explored with an objective to point out a number  of open research issues. Finally, testbeds, industrial practice, and  current standard activities related to WMNs are highlighted.
