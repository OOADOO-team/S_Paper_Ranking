name: Optimal redundant systems for works with random processing timeurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0951832013000446public_in: 《Reliability Engineering &amp; System Safety》authors: M. Chen,T. Nakagawa,abstract: This paper studies the optimal redundant policies for a manufacturing system processing jobs with random working times. The redundant units of the parallel systems and standby systems are subject to stochastic failures during the continuous production process. First, a job consisting of only one work is considered for both redundant systems and the expected cost functions are obtained. Next, each redundant system with a random number of units is assumed for a single work. The expected cost functions and the optimal expected numbers of units are derived for redundant systems. Subsequently, the production processes of N tandem works are introduced for parallel and standby systems, and the expected cost functions are also summarized. Finally, the number of works is estimated by a Poisson distribution for the parallel and standby systems. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the optimization problems of redundant systems.citations_number: 7Citation: Scheduling: Theory, Algorithms and Systems Development "Michael Pinedo" "Khosrow Hadavi" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0eb215dc4038e2c2d9d791ee1a3ed403Advanced Reliability Models and Maintenance Policies "Toshio Nakagawa" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bfe85b64d47f68900d4681cfb7a7b882Simulation method for dispatching national border security manpower to mitigate manpower shortage "PoTsang B.
