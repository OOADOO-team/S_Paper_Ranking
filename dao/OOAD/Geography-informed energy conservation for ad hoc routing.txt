name: Geography-informed energy conservation for ad hoc routingurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2367993_Geography-informed_Energy_Conservation_for_Ad_Hoc_Routing?citationList=outgoingpublic_in: ACM/IEEE 7th Int 1 Conf. on Mobile Computing and Networking (Mobi-Com2001), Julyauthors: XU,Y.,abstract: We introduce a geographical adaptive fidelity (GAF) algorithm that reduces energy consumption in ad hoc wireless networks. GAF conserves energy by identifying nodes that are equivalent from a routing perspective and then turning off unnecessary nodes, keeping a constant level of routing fidelity. GAF moderates this policy using application- and system-level information; nodes that source or sink data remain on and intermediate nodes monitor and balance energy use. GAF is independent of the underlying ad hoc routing protocol; we simulate GAF over unmodified AODV and DSR. Analysis and simulation studies of GAF show that it can consume 40% to 60% less energy than an unmodified ad hoc routing protocol. Moreover, simulations of GAF suggest that network lifetime increases proportionally to node density; in one example, a four-fold increase in node density leads to network lifetime increase for 3 to 6 times (depending on the mobility pattern). More generally, GAF is an example of adaptive fidelity, a technique proposed for extending the lifetime of self-configuring systems by exploiting redundancy to conserve energy while maintaining application fidelity.citations_number: 4166Citation: Secure routing in wireless sensor networks: attacks and countermeasures "C.
