name: Random-Based Scheduling New Approximations and LP Lower Bounds (Extended Abstract)url: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/3-540-63248-4_11public_in: Noneauthors: Andreas S. Schulz,Martin Skutella,abstract: Abstract Three characteristics encountered frequently in real-wor ld machine scheduling are jobs released over time, precedence constra ints between jobs, and average performance optimization. The general constrained one-machine schedul- ing problem to minimize the average weighted completion time not only captures these features, but also is an important building block for m ore complex problems involving multiple machines. In this context, the conversion of preemptive to nonpreemptive schedules has been established as a strong and useful tool for the design of approximation algo- rithms. The preemptive problem is already NP-hard, but one can generate good preemptive schedules from LP relaxations in time-indexed variables. However, a straightforward combination of these two components does not directly lead to improved approximations. By showing schedules in slow motion, we introduce a new point of view on the generation of preemptive schedules from LP-solutions which also enables us to give a better analysis. Specifically, this leads to a randomized approximation algo rithm for the general constrained one-machine scheduling problem with expected performance guar- antee e. This improves upon the best previously known worst-case bound of 3. In the process, we also give randomized algorithms for related problems involving precedences that asymptotically match the best previously known performance guarantees. In addition, by exploiting a different technique, we give a s imple 3 2-approxima- tion algorithm for unrelated parallel machine scheduling t o minimize the average weighted completion time. It relies on random machine assignments where these random assignments are again guided by an optimum solution to an LP relax- ation. For the special case of identical parallel machines, this algorithm is as simple as the one of Kawaguchi and Kyan (KK86), but allows for a remarkably simpler analysis. Interestingly, its derandomized versio n actually is the algorithm of Kawaguchi and Kyan.citations_number: 76Citation: Approximation Techniques for Average Completion Time Scheduling "Chekuri, C" "Motwani, R" "Natarajan, B" "Stein, C" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=616c3e23a421211f3b7969dbb387e822Approximation techniques for average completion time scheduling "C.
