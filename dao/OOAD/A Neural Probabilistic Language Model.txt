name: A Neural Probabilistic Language Modelurl: http://link.springer.com/10.1007/3-540-33486-6_6public_in: Noneauthors: Editors: Jaz Kandola,Thomas Hofmann,Tomaso Poggio,abstract: A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.citations_number: 2433Citation: Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space "Mikolov, Tomas" "Chen, Kai" "Corrado, Greg" "Dean, Jeffrey" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9b96fcef89a076065163c0793f74f68cLearning Deep Architectures for AI "Yoshua Bengio" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5d96c4426febc145d554eb2541931ce9Neural Probabilistic Language Models "Yoshua Bengio" "Holger Schwenk" "Jean-Sébastien Senécal" "Fréderic Morin" "Jean-Luc Gauvain" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a5ecef3e387847297d206ee8e86b705dRepresentation Learning: A Review and New Perspectives "Yoshua Bengio" "Aaron Courville" "Pascal Vincent" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=14655222a985bcb548e882bcd92e006bWord representations: a simple and general method for semi-supervised learning "Turian, Joseph" "Ratinov, Lev" "Bengio, Yoshua" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a690e8039b3fa59b7e1cff9316bbd2f6Deep visual-semantic alignments for generating image descriptions "Andrej Karpathy" "Li Fei-Fei" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4bdd0b0c18ffb914454b53ad0da75588Learning word vectors for sentiment analysis "Andrew L.
