name: Leisure-time physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness and work ability: a study in randomly selected residents of Lódź.url: http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20053030488.htmlpublic_in: 《International Journal of Occupational Medicine &amp; Environmental Health》authors: Dorota Kaleta,Teresa MakowiecDabrowska,Anna Jegier,abstract: Objectives: Low physical activity is a serious health problem in developed and developing countries. Much attention is also given to the role of physical activity in the modification of work ability in adults. The aim of this study was to assess leisure-time physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness and their influence on the subjective work ability in a randomly selected group of professionally active residents of LÃ³dz. Materials and Methods: The study was performed in the randomly selected group of professionally active persons (n =198). Physical activity was determined by means of the Seven Day Physical Activity Recall (SDPAR). To determine cardiorespiratory fitness in the examined persons, the submaximal treadmill test was performed. Subjective work ability was evaluated using the work ability index (WAI). Results: Correlation coefficient for the WAI and leisure-time physical activity was high r =0.3,p &lt; 0.0001. Moreover, WAI, its compounds and cardiorespiratory fitness were highly correlated r =0.4, p &lt; 0.0001. Conclusions: Our analysis of leisure-time physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness and WAI emphasizes a great, potential feasibility of improving the WAI and its components, e.g., through the development, promotion, and broad use of training schedules.citations_number: 20Citation: Depressive Symptoms, Health Behaviors, and Risk of Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Coronary Heart Disease "Mary A.
