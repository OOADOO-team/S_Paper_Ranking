name: High Entropy Random Selection Protocolsurl: http://www.springerlink.com/content/15p336k580618603public_in: International Workshop on Approximation &amp; the International Workshop on Randomizationauthors: Harry Buhrman,Matthias Christandl,Zvi Lotker,abstract: We study the two party problem of randomly selecting a string among  all the strings of length n. We want the protocol to have the  property that the output distribution has high entropy, even  when one of the two parties is dishonest and deviates from the  protocol. We develop protocols that achieve high, close to n,  entropy.  In the literature the randomness guarantee is usually expressed as  being close to the uniform distribution or in terms of resiliency.  The notion of entropy is not directly comparable to that of  resiliency, but we establish a connection between the two that  allows us to compare our protocols with the existing ones.We construct an  explicit protocol that yields entropy n - O(1) and has 4log^* n  rounds, improving over the protocol of Goldwasser  et al. that also achieves this entropy but needs O(n)  rounds. Both these protocols need O(n^2) bits of communication.  Next we reduce the communication in our protocols. We show the existence,  non-explicitly, of a protocol that has 6-rounds, 2n + 8log n bits  of communication and yields entropy n- O(log n) and min-entropy  n/2 - O(log n). Our protocol achieves the same entropy bound as  the recent, also non-explicit, protocol of Gradwohl  et al., however achieves much higher min-entropy: n/2 -  O(log n) versus O(log n).  Finally we exhibit very simple explicit protocols. We connect the  security parameter of these geometric protocols with the well  studied Kakeya problem motivated by harmonic analysis and analytical  number theory. We are only able to prove that these protocols have  entropy 3n/4 but still n/2 - O(log n) min-entropy. Therefore  they do not perform as well with respect to the explicit  constructions of Gradwohl et al. entropy-wise, but still  have much better min-entropy.  We conjecture that these simple  protocols achieve n -o(n) entropy.  Our geometric  construction and its relation to the Kakeya problem follows a new and  different approach to the random selection problem than any of the  previously known protocols.citations_number: 4Citation: Experimental quantum tossing of a single coin "A Nguyen" "J Frison" "K Phan Huy" "S Massar" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=753ce15920b8f9ef171e141c681588b8Semi-Loss-Tolerant Strong Coin Flipping Protocol Using EPR Pairs "Ma, Jia-Jun" "Guo, Fen-Zhuo" "Yang, Qian" "Li, Yan-Bing" "Wen, Qiao-Yan" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ef5f57fe5b8da4bd74379467df25e5cbRandom Selection in Few Rounds "Timofey Stepanov" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fc37df178c9ef99d8e3021d59f030f1cReferences: Free bits, PCPs and non-approximability-towards tight results "M.
