name: Directed diffusion : A scalable and robust communication paradigm for sensor networksurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/240388892_Usion_a_scalable_and_robust_communication_paradigm_for_sensor_networkspublic_in: Proc. ACM MobiCom &#039;00, Aug.authors: INTANGONWIWAT,C.,abstract: Advances in processor, memory and radio technology will enable small and cheap nodes capable of sensing, communication and computation. Networks of such nodes can coordinate to perform distributed sensing of environmental phenomena. In this paper, we explore the directed diffusion paradigm for such coordination. Directed diffusion is datacentric in that all communication is for named data. All nodes in a directed diffusion-based network are application-aware. This enables diffusion to achieve energy savings by selecting empirically good paths and by caching and processing data in-network. We explore and evaluate the use of directed diffusion for a simple remote-surveillance sensor network.citations_number: 8155Citation: A survey on sensor networks "I. F. Akyildiz" "Weilian Su" "Y.
