name: Performance analysis of the CONFIDANT protocol: Cooperation Of Nodes-Fairness In Distributed Ad-hoc NeTworksurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/220270655_Performance_analysis_of_the_CONFIDANT_protocolpublic_in: Noneauthors: S. Buchegger,J. Y Le Boudec,abstract: Mobile ad-hoc networking works properly only if the participating nodes cooperate in routing and forwarding. However,it may be advantageous for individual nodes not to cooperate. We propose a protocol, called CONFIDANT, for making misbehavior unattractive; it is based on selective altruism and utilitarianism. It aims at detecting and isolating misbehaving nodes, thus making it unattractive to deny cooperation. Trust relationships and routing decisions are based on experienced, observed, or reported routing and forwarding behavior of other nodes. The detailed implementation of CONFIDANT in this paper assumes that the network layer is based on the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol. We present a performance analysis of DSR fortified by CONFIDANT and compare it to regular defenseless DSR. It shows that a network with CONFIDANT and up to 60% of misbehaving nodes behaves almost as well as a benign network, in sharp contrast to a defenseless network. All simulations have been implemented and performed in GloMoSim.citations_number: 2439Citation: Secure routing for mobile ad hoc networks "Argyroudis, P.G" "O'Mahony, D" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=770ed8f4c9da06e882da3f69bab90ceeStimulating Cooperation in Self-Organizing Mobile Ad Hoc Networks "Levente Buttyán" "Jean-Pierre Hubaux" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d7aab3de9940f5399ad8fe73468d5f10Sprite: A Simple, Cheat-Proof, Credit-Based System for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks "Zhong, Sheng" "Chen, Jiang" "Yang, Yang Richard" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b4e36d17d505617b7f29340cac369a13Sprite: a simple, cheat-proof, credit-based system for mobile ad-hoc networks "Zhong, S" "Chen, J" "Yang, Y.R" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=753f6e52f83d53ffeae212d7b553a7d2Ad hoc-VCG:a truthful and cost-efficient routing protocol for mobile ad hoc networks with selfish agents "Luzi Anderegg" "Stephan Eidenbenz" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a3b4ed70dbd10951781fa0c8c4b8ab2cA survey of secure wireless ad hoc routing "YihChun, Hu" "Perrig, A" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=78a292a3e95183c2a05e2c3113c2f848SORI: a secure and objective reputation-based incentive scheme for ad-hoc networks "Qi He" "Dapeng Wu" "Khosla, Pradeep" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cac8e1f950b609705f011ac1c13c753dNash Equilibria of Packet Forwarding Strategies in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks "Mark Felegyhazi" "Jean-Pierre Hubaux" "Levente Buttyan" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d2d98dfb3c132442bacff69370b25675A Micro-Payment Scheme Encouraging Collaboration in Multi-hop Cellular Networks "Markus Jakobsson" "Jean-Pierre Hubaux" "Levente Buttyán" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3ace566c7747b1657cb95a857faae7ecReferences: GloMoSim: A Library for Parallel Simulation of Large-Scale Wireless Networks "X.
