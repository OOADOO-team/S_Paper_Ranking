name: Fast Learning in Networks of Locally-Tuned Processing Unitsurl: http://www.emeraldinsight.com/servlet/linkout?suffix=b7&amp;dbid=16&amp;doi=10.1108%2F03684929810240338&amp;key=10.1162%2Fneco.1989.1.2.281public_in: Neural Computationauthors: Moody, John, Darken, Christian J.,abstract: The authors propose a network architecture which uses a single  internal layer of locally-tuned processing units to learn both classification tasks and real-valued function approximations. (Moody and  Darken 1988). They consider training such networks in a completely supervised manner, but abandon this approach in favor of a more computationally efficient hybrid learning method which combines self-organized and supervised learning. Their networks learn faster than  backpropagation for two reasons: the local representations ensure that  only a few units respond to any given input, thus reducing computational  overhead, and the hybrid learning rules are linear rather than  nonlinear, thus leading to faster convergence. Unlike many existing  methods for data analysis, the network architecture and learning rules  are truly adaptive and are thus appropriate for real-time usecitations_number: 5269Citation: ANFIS: Adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system.
