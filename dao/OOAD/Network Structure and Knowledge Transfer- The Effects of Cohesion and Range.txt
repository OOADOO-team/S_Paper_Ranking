name: Network Structure and Knowledge Transfer: The Effects of Cohesion and Rangeurl: http://openurl.ebscohost.com/linksvc/linking.aspx?stitle=Administrative%20Science%20Quarterly&volume=48&issue=2&spage=240public_in: Administrative Science Quarterlyauthors: Ray Reagans and Bill McEvily,abstract: This research considers how different features of informal networks affect knowledge transfer. As a complement to previous research that has emphasized the dyadic tie strength component of informal networks, we focus on how network structure influences the knowledge transfer process. We propose that social cohesion around a relationship affects the willingness and motivation of individuals to invest time, energy, and effort in sharing knowledge with others. We further argue that the network range, ties to different knowledge pools, increases a person&#039;s ability to convey complex ideas to heterogeneous audiences. We also examine explanations for knowledge transfer based on absorptive capacity, which emphasizes the role of common knowledge, and relational embeddedness, which stresses the importance of tie strength. We investigate the network effect on knowledge transfer using data from a contract R&amp;D firm. The results indicate that both social cohesion and network range ease knowledge transfer, over and above the effect for the strength of the tie between two people. We discuss the implications of these findings for research on effective knowledge transfer, social capital, and information diffusion.citations_number: 2210Citation: Structural holes and good ideas "Ronald S. Burt" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b75a03e25ff3947136d95d0c96f97c8Group Social Capital and Group Effectiveness: The Role of Informal Socializing Ties "Hongseok Oh" "Myung-Ho Chung" "Giuseppe Labianca" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=54f597316a9016e47cdc46ce70168a72Inter‐ and Intra‐Organizational Knowledge Transfer: A Meta‐Analytic Review and Assessment of its Antecedents and Consequences "Raymond Van Wijk" "Justin J.
