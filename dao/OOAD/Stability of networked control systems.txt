Then, we summarize the fundamental issues in NCSs and examine them with different underlying network-scheduling protocols. We present NCS models with network-induced  delay and analyze their stability using stability regions and a hybrid  systems technique. Following that, we discuss methods to compensate  network-induced delay and present experimental results over a physical  network. Then, we model NCSs with packet dropout and multiple-packet  transmission as asynchronous dynamical systems and analyze their  stability. Finally, we present our conclusionscitations_number: 4477Citation: A Survey of Recent Results in Networked Control Systems "Joo P.
