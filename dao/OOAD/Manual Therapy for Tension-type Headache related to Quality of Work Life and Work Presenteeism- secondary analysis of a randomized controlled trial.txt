This study is a secondary analysis of a factorial, randomized clinical trial on manual therapy interventions. Altogether, 80 patients (85% women) with TTH and without current symptoms of any other concomitant disease participated. An experienced therapist delivered the treatment: myofascial inhibitory technique (IT), articulatory technique (AT), combined technique (IT and AT), and control group (no treatment). In general, all treatments as compared to our control group had a large effect (f≥.69) in the improvement of participants’ quality of work life. Work presenteeism interacted with TTH treatment type’s efficacy on participant’s quality of work life. The inhibitory technique lead to higher reports of quality of work life than other treatment options only for participants with very low frequency of work presenteeism. In turn, TTH articulatory treatment techniques resulted in higher reports of quality of work life for a high to very high work presenteeism frequency. Articulatory manipulation technique is the more efficient treatment to improve quality of work life when the frequency of work presenteeism is high. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.citations_number: 3Citation: Association between tension-type headache and temporomandibular dysfuntion according to the DC\/TMD INDEX "Huapaya Pardavé, María del Carmen" "Lozano Castro, Felipe Enrique" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=37e31bf8b766dbf601989336b2d37efcReferences:
