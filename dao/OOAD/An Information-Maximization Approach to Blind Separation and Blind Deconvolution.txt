name: An Information-Maximization Approach to Blind Separation and Blind Deconvolutionurl: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7584893?access_num=7584893&amp;link_type=MED&amp;dopt=Abstractpublic_in: Neural Computationauthors: Bell, Anthony J., Sejnowski, Terrence J.,abstract: We derive a new self organizing learning algorithm that maximizes  the information transferred in a network of nonlinear units. The  algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and  is defined here for the zero noise limit. Under these conditions, information maximization has extra properties not found in the linear case (R. Linsker 1989). The nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the  output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher order generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network to  the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information maximization provides a unifying framework for problems in ldquoblindrdquo signal processingcitations_number: 9382Citation: Learning the parts of objects by non-negative matrix factorization "Daniel D.
