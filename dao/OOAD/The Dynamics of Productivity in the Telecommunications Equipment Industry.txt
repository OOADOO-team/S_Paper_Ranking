name: The Dynamics of Productivity in the Telecommunications Equipment Industryurl: http://www.jstor.org/stable/2171831public_in: Econometricaauthors: Olley, G Steven,Pakes, Ariel,abstract: Technological change and deregulation have caused a major restructuring telecommunications equipment industry over the last two decades. Our empirical focus is on estimating the parameters of a production function for the equipment industry, and then using those estimates to analyze the evolution of plant-level productivity. The restructuring involved significant entry and exit and large changes in the sizes of incumbents. This generates a selection and a simultaneity problem when estimating production functions. Our theoretical focus is on providing an estimation algorithm which takes explicit account of these issues. We find that our algorithm produces markedly different estimates of production function coefficients than do traditional estimation procedures, and that the productivity increases that followed deregulation were primarily a result of a reallocation of capital towards more productive establishments.
