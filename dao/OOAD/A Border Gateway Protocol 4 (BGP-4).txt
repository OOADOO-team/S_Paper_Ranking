name: A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4)url: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2917310_A_border_gateway_protocol_4_(BGP-4)public_in: Noneauthors: Hares, Susan,Rekhter, Yakov,Li, Tony,abstract: This document discusses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is aninter-Autonomous System routing protocol.  The primary function of aBGP speaking system is to exchange network reachability informationwith other BGP systems. This network reachability information includesinformation on the list of Autonomous Systems (ASes) that reachabilityinformation traverses. This information is sufficient for constructinga graph of AS connectivity for this reachability from which routingloops may be pruned, and, at the AS level, some policy decisions maybe enforced.  BGP-4 provides a set of mechanisms for supportingClassless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). These mechanisms includesupport for advertising a set of destinations as an IP prefix, andeliminating the concept of network &quot;class&quot; within BGP. BGP-4 alsointroduces mechanisms that allow aggregation of routes, includingaggregation of AS paths.  This document obsoletes RFC 1771.[STANDARDS-TRACK]citations_number: 2264Citation: Interconnecting Smart Objects with IP "Jean-Philippe Vasseur" "Adam Dunkels" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=02822cd88e81d7db0f47b5a5e416653dPHAS: a prefix hijack alert system "Mohit Lad" "Dan Pei" "Dan Pei" "Yiguo Wu" "Beichuan Zhang" "Lixia Zhang" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bd5e9d0b9016ef116abcae78fd45ee84Blueprint for the Intercloud - Protocols and Formats for Cloud Computing Interoperability "David Bernstein" "Erik Ludvigson" "Krishna Sankar" "Steve Diamond" "Monique Morrow" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bf541bb9d0b82b9f30a4abaf1b1a6d29A Survey of BGP Security Issues and Solutions "Kevin Butler" "Toni R.
