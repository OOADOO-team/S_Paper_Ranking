name: LEAP:efficient security mechanisms for large-scale distributed sensor networksurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2872335_LEAP_Efficient_Security_Mechanisms_for_Large-Scale_Distributed_Sensor_Networkspublic_in: Acm Conference on Computer &amp; Communications Securityauthors: Sencun Zhu,Sanjeev Setia,Sushil Jajodia,abstract: In this paper, we describe LEAP (Localized Encryption and Authentication Protocol), a key management protocol for sensor networks that is designed to support in-network processing, while at the same time restricting the security impact of a node compromise to the immediate network neighborhood of the compromised node. The design of the protocol is motivated by the observation that different types of messages exchanged between sensor nodes have different security requirements, and that a single keying mechanism is not suitable for meeting these different security requirements. LEAP supports the establishment of four types of keys for each sensor node -- an individual key shared with the base station, a pairwise key shared with another sensor node, a cluster key shared with multiple neighboring nodes, and a group key that is shared by all the nodes in the network. The protocol used for establishing and updating these keys is communication- and energy-efficient, and minimizes the involvement of the base station. LEAP also includes an efficient protocol for inter-node traffic authentication based on the use of one-way key chains. A salient feature of the authentication protocol is that it supports source authentication without precluding in-network processing and passive participation. We analyze the performance and the security of our scheme under various attack models and show our schemes are very efficient in defending against many attacks.citations_number: 2167Citation: LEAP:efficient security mechanisms for large-scale distributed sensor networks "Sencun Zhu" "Sanjeev Setia" "Sushil Jajodia" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=03f4ab3c5a459d4353fa898917f2dfbaPoster abstract: LEAP—efficient security mechanisms for large-scale distributed sensor networks "Zhu, Sencun" "Setia, Sanjeev" "Jajodia, Sushil" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6322309f8e817c45d1e771505e99fc01LEAP+: Efficient security mechanisms for large-scale distributed sensor networks "Zhu, Sencun" "Setia, Sanjeev" "Jajodia, Sushil" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8014ebbfb999e646589d23271a792b04无线传感器网络的研究进展 "李建中" "高宏" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2f51f0418bf6b26dafbcebab69fec85aAn interleaved hop-by-hop authentication scheme for filtering of injected false data in sensor networks "Sencun Zhu" "Setia, S" "Jajodia, S" "Peng Ning" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=00b23d6f4e1a5122b487f7de8c945a8aGlobal clock synchronization in sensor networks "Fabian Kuhn" "Thomas Locher" "Rotem Oshman" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=968feba6b95672b3669a9779b64dcd89A survey of security issues in wireless sensor networks "Yong Wang" "Attebury, G" "Ramamurthy, B" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0b1c50a8fd1bf69af38fe583715dac2bPIKE: peer intermediaries for key establishment in sensor networks "Haowen Chan" "Perrig, A" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=47ee1f8e109db1beff84e3ebf643ee10Combinatorial Design of Key Distribution Mechanisms for Wireless Sensor Networks "Seyit A.
