name:  [ACM Press Proceeding of the 1st ACM SIGMOBILE workshop - Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China (2008.05.26-2008.05.26)] Proceeding of the 1st ACM SIGMOBILE workshop on Mobility models  - MobilityModels \"08 - Infection spread in wireless networks with random and adversarial node mobilitiesurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221628428_Infection_spread_in_wireless_networks_with_random_and_adversarial_node_mobilitiespublic_in: Noneauthors: Wang, Yi, Kapadia, Shyam, Krishnamachari, Bhaskar,abstract: We study the process of the spread of an infection among mobile nodes moving on a finite, grid based map. A random walk and a novel adversarial model are considered as two extreme cases of node mobility. With N nodes, we present analytical and simulation results for both mobility models for a square grid map with size &amp;#8730;G &amp;#215; &amp;#8730;G. A key finding is that with random mobility the total time to infect all nodes decreases with N while with an adversarial model we observe a reverse trend. Specifically, the random case results in a total infection time of &amp;#920;(GlogGlogN/(N) as opposed to the adversarial case where the total infection time is found to be &amp;#920;(&amp;#8730;(Glog(N). We also explore the possibility of emulating such an infection process as a mobile interaction game with wireless sensor motes, and the above results are complimented by traces obtained from an empirical study with humans as players in an outdoor field.citations_number: 5Citation: Tight bounds on information dissemination in sparse mobile networks "Alberto Pettarin" "Andrea Pietracaprina" "Geppino Pucci" "Eli Upfal" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7e385a5ae6ee9d02b0984e728ee51131Findings from an empirical study of fine-grained human social contacts "Yi Wang" "Krishnamachari, B" "Valente, T.W" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=214da1f0a326c74cfb7932007baaf1e6Information dissemination via random walks in d -dimensional space "Lam" "Henry" "Liu" "Zhenming" "Mitzenmacher" "Michael" "Xiaorui" "Wang" "Yajun" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9416751872783a96f8335eff03689211Infectious Random Walks "Alberto Pettarin" "Andrea Pietracaprina" "Geppino Pucci" "Eli Upfal" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f3ffe7791b5ffabeabce40a48ec31babInformation dissemination via random walks in d -dimensional space "Henry Lam" "Zhenming Liu" "Michael Mitzenmacher" "Xiaorui Sun" "Yajun Wang" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f11068c76eb2601692d3d07a25d08df0References: Performance comparison of two on-demand routing protocols for ad hoc networks "S.R.
