name: Support-vector networksurl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00994018public_in: Machine Learningauthors: Corinna Cortes,Vladimir Vapnik,abstract: The support-vector network  is a new learning machine for two-group classification problems. The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demonstrated. We also compare the performance of the support-vector network to various classical learning algorithms that all took part in a benchmark study of Optical Character Recognition.citations_number: 2Citation: LIBSVM: A library for support vector machines "Chang, ChihChung" "Lin, ChihJen" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b1552ffd60e8a942090f6dfadd26687Text categorization with Support Vector Machines: Learning with many relevant features "Thorsten Joachims" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=58aa6cfa340e6ae6809c5deadd07d88eText categorization with Support Vector Machines: Learning with many relevant features "Thorsten Joachims" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2f3ab6001f10fb375bcdb6d859e23e5eA comparison of methods for multiclass support vector machines "Hsu, ChihWei" "Lin, ChihJen" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b9cd4bfb4d07c34b416308b85ebf97a1A Comparison of Methods for Multiclass Support Vector Machines "Hsu CW" "Lin CJ" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1be26f8d6e2f32156cda4d10c6807e66Gene Selection for Cancer Classification using Support Vector Machines "Isabelle Guyon" "Jason Weston" "Stephen Barnhill" "Vladimir Vapnik" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8854f0c7f668ca96b4ea79e580d025b0关于统计学习理论与支持向量机 "张学工" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9ff9531735d1c3074a95810c88dfd009Modern Applied Statistics with S-PLUS "W.
