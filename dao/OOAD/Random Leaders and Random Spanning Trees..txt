name: Random Leaders and Random Spanning Trees.url: http://www.springerlink.com/content/y84524536t3312r0public_in: International Workshop on Distributed Algorithmsauthors: Judit Bar-ilan,Dror Zernik,abstract: The problem of distributively constructing a minimum spanning tree has been thoroughly studied. The root of this spanning tree is often elected as a leader, and then centralized algorithms are run incitations_number: 30Citation: Comparison of initial conditions for distributed algorithms on anonymous networks "Naoshi Sakamoto" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4e197a9b86f0af1aa274480e411faa87Distributed Random Walks "Atish Das Sarma" "Danupon Nanongkai" "Gopal Pandurangan" "Prasad Tetali" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=403a0b8e496e38d856e30ae8b7783246Fast distributed random walks "Atish Das Sarma" "Danupon Nanongkai" "Gopal Pandurangan" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d2ba93f565f96badeef5118cf9e3cc89Random walks in distributed computing: a survey "Marc Bui" "Thibault Bernard" "Devan Sohier" "Alain Bui" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f74ab09b72c0a074e4592688192d7327Distributed Computation of a Spanning Tree in a Dynamic Graph by Mobile Agents "S.
