name: Is the differential frequency-based attack effective against random delay insertion?url: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/224082369_Is_the_differential_frequency-based_attack_effective_against_random_delay_insertionpublic_in: IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systemsauthors: Lu, Y,Boey, K.H,O'Neill, M,abstract: The secret key stored in a cryptographic device can be revealed from the power consumption using statistical analysis in a technique known as Differential Power Analysis (DPA). However, DPA attacks are sensitive to measurement misalignments in the power samples that reduce the dependency between the power and the data. A countermeasure technique that increases this misalignment by inserting random delays between operations, known as Random Delay Insertion, was shown in previous research to be effective against DPA on hardware implementations. A Differential Frequency-based Attack (DFBA) is a DPA technique that involves a frequency-based preprocessing step and it can be utilized to attack security implementations that include misalignments. In this research, a DFBA attack is carried out on an AES algorithm implemented on both ASIC and FPGA devices. The results indicate that the length of delay which the DFBA attack can reduce is limited. Therefore, the RDI countermeasure is effective against DFBA when the inserted delay is larger than the effective DFBA window size.citations_number: 6Citation: Blind Source Separation from Single Measurements Using Singular Spectrum Analysis "Santos Merino Del Pozo" "François-Xavier Standaert" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5e7cf2722f9c96df3486b964b49024afDifferential Power Analysis using wavelet decomposition "Patel, H" "Baldwin, R" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ffa3a9609349840495dc0ae7e32a681cBinary compatibility for embedded systems using greedy subgraph mapping "CHEN XuHao" "SHEN Li" "WANG ZhiYing" "ZHENG Zhong" "CHEN Wei" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=062bd8fc0653f6b5fc35144cfcc4b58bBlind Source Separation from Single Measurements Using Singular Spectrum Analysis "Santos Merino Del Pozo" "François-Xavier Standaert" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=73165ca7a7c4a43804e23e89f350aaceReferences: Correlation Power Analysis with a Leakage Model "Eric Brier" "Christophe Clavier" "Francis Olivier" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9c2ee61dc701c0e79881c3b77cd2973cCorrelation Power Analysis with a Leakage Model "Eric Brier" "Christophe Clavier" "Francis Olivier" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=51b96b08731fc8289fae78a8c8f36c29Correlation Power Analysis with a Leakage Model "Eric Brier" "Christophe Clavier" "Francis Olivier" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cf2dfe152888b4fd0debb72c9de8fea2A dynamic and differential CMOS logic with signal independent power consumption to withstand differential power analysis on smart cards "Tiri, K" "Akmal, M" "Verbauwhede, I" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5c50b0efee9250ea43510ba8c8fd4f97Differential Power Analysis in the Presence of Hardware Countermeasures "Christophe Clavier" "Nora Dabbous" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fe62e76fb9ce97dc2871f3770adf6513Differential Power Analysis in the Presence of Hardware Countermeasures "Christophe Clavier" "JeanSébastien Coron" "Nora Dabbous" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=31508a4b027dda5001d978557436089bEM Analysis of Rijndael and ECC on a Wireless Java-Based PDA "Catherine H.
