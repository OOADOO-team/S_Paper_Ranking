name: Unbiased Random Sequences from Quasigroup String Transformationsurl: http://link.springer.com/10.1007/11502760_11public_in: Fast Software Encryption: 12th International Workshop, FSE 2005, Paris, France, February 21-23, 2005, Revised Selected Papersauthors: Smile Markovski,Danilo Gligoroski,Ljupco Kocarev,abstract: Summary: The need of true random number generators for many purposes (ranging from applications in cryptography and stochastic simulation, to search heuristics and game playing) is increasing every day. Many sources of randomness possess the property of stationarity. However, while a biased die may be a good source of entropy, many applications require input in the form of unbiased bits, rather than biased ones. In this paper, we present a new technique for simulating fair coin flips using a biased, stationary source of randomness. Moreover, the same technique can also be used to improve some of the properties of pseudo random number generators. In particular, an improved pseudo random number generator has almost unmeasurable period, uniform distribution of the letters, pairs of letters, triples of letters, and so on, and passes many statistical tests of randomness. Our algorithm for simulating fair coin flips using a biased, stationary source of randomness (or for improving the properties of pseudo random number generators) is designed by using quasigroup string transformations and its properties are mathematically provable. It is very flexible, the input/output strings can be of 2-bits letters, 4-bits letters, bytes, 2-bytes letters, and so on. It is of linear complexity and it needs less than 1Kb memory space in its 2-bits and 4-bits implementations, hence it is suitable for embedded systems as well.citations_number: 34Citation: Bad and good ways of post-processing biased physical random numbers "Markus Dichtl" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4200bb82b0f949582d70d62e8827c1efCandidate One-Way Functions and One-Way Permutations Based on Quasigroup String Transformations "Gligoroski, Danilo" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=77035cff2cda572101c53a61b7fe1489Cryptanalysis of pomaranch "Cid, C" "Gilbert, H" "Johansson, T" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e45822af6e2deace0296e1a1601eee6bPeriod of streamcipher Edon80 "Jin Hong" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6ac89fd48b445f15f172abd2d9ed4422Period of streamcipher Edon80 "JIN HONG" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5e725c93db0e9f637774279c5a18c394Error-Correcting Codes Based on Quasigroups "Danilo Gligoroski" "Smile Markovski" "Ljupco Kocarev" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5bd6aaae652c2d0af33b358f25404a93Generating huge quasigroups from small non-linear bijections via extended Feistel function "Markovski, Smile" "Mileva, Aleksandra" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=861f27633916e095d05b303f06f03725Quasigroups with good statistical properties.
