J., Reittu, H.,abstract: BitTorrent revolutionized the technique of distributing a very large file to a very large number of recipients. The file is chopped into small chunks that the recipients can immediately upload further. In the original design, a &quot;tracker&quot; keeps certain centralized control over the chunk transfer process. This paper studies a BitTorrent-like &quot;information diffusion&quot; system that has a fully distributed and symmetric architecture. The peers join a Distributed Hash Table -based overlay network and contact each other randomly. This kind of designs have been implemented and analysed recently. A trackerless BitTorrent system has been introduced which can be regarded as one based on random encounters --- the participating nodes contact each other at random and download missing chunks. On the analytical front, Massoulie and Vojnovic showed that a random encounter based system has surprisingly good performance without any chunk preference strategies, with the condition that each peer gets its first chunk from a sufficiently uniform distribution. In this paper, we focus on a scenario where this condition cannot be guaranteed, and show that a &quot;rare chunk phenomenon&quot; easily occurs, if both the encounters and the chunk selection are random. Classic urn models give some mathematical understanding of this phenomenon. We then discuss various techniques for alleviating the rare chunk problem and propose a simple distributed chunk selection policy that reduces the imbalance in the distribution of chunks within the network.citations_number: 27Citation: An experimental analysis of Joost peer-to-peer VoD service "Jun Lei" "Lei Shi" "Xiaoming Fu" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e3d3efc973aba0b633a192c4b99d4831On the stability of two-chunk file-sharing systems "Norros, Ilkka" "Reittu, Hannu" "Eirola, Timo" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0f9880c07237d2cb3582c36e624c8495Scaling Laws for File Dissemination in P2P Networks with Random Contacts "Rudesindo Nunez-Queija" "Balakrishna Prabhu" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d2a8a9614055ddb36709936b5085f6c2A Stable Random-Contact Algorithm for Peer-to-Peer File Sharing "Hannu Reittu" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d044a60a90a9eac0cd2ef514bbdfef9cToward modeling of a single file broadcasting in a closed network "Reittu, H" "Norros, I" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2fc77a36abfe356e82d70a8388a2e73bOn Uncoordinated File Distribution with Non-altruistic Downloaders "Ilkka Norros" "Balakrishna Prabhu" "Hannu Reittu" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c62ee966afaf844c6528d302cdce57d6Formalization of emergence in multi-agent systems "Teo, Yong Meng" "Luong, Ba Linh" "Szabo, Claudia" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=89bca09963dc65990abffd3766cfdf5fRelying on randomness PlanetLab experiments with distributed file-sharing protocols "Norros, I" "Pehkonen, V" "Reittu, H" "Binzenhofer, A" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=aa04c0b500d4775fd4506647b2025255Formalization of Weak Emergence in Multiagent Systems "Szabo, Claudia" "Teo, Yong Meng" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=18a531a611ae83f8db7f4613e2392116Mastering selfishness and heterogeneity in mobile P2P content distribution networks with multiple source download in cellular networks "Schlosser, Daniel" "Hoßfeld, Tobias" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=965dd5e46b6a49459f03c9c8ec6838c4References: Cooperative Content Distribution: Scalability Through Self-Organization "Pascal Felber" "Ernst W.
