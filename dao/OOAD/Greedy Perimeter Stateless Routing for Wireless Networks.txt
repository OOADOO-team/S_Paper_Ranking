name: Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing for Wireless Networksurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2327596_GPSR_Greedy_Perimeter_Stateless_Routing_for_Wireless_Networkspublic_in: International Conference on Mobile Computing &amp; Networkingauthors: Brad Karp,H. T. Kung,abstract: We present Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR), a novel routing protocol for wireless datagram networks that uses the positions of routers and a packet&#039;s destination to make packet forwarding decisions. GPSR makes greedy forwarding decisions using only information about a router&#039;s immediate neighbors in the network topology. When a packet reaches a region where greedy forwarding is impossible, the algorithm recovers by routing around the perimeter of the region. By keeping state only about the local topology, GPSR scales better in per-router state than shortest-path and ad-hoc routing protocols as the number of network destinations increases. Under mobility&#039;s frequent topology changes, GPSR can use local topology information to find correct new routes quickly. We describe the GPSR protocol, and use extensive simulation of mobile wireless networks to compare its performance with that of Dynamic Source Routing. Our simulations demonstrate GPSR&#039;s scalability on densely deployed wireless networks.citations_number: 8298Citation: Secure routing in wireless sensor networks: attacks and countermeasures "C.
