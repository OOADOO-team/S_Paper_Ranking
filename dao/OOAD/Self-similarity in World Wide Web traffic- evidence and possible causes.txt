name: Self-similarity in World Wide Web traffic: evidence and possible causesurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/3334508_Self-similarity_in_World_Wide_Web_traffic_evidence_and_possible_causespublic_in: IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networkingauthors: M.E. Crovella,A. Bestavros,abstract: The notion of self-similarity has been shown to apply to wide-area and local-area network traffic. We show evidence that the subset of network traffic that is due to World Wide Web (WWW) transfers can show characteristics that are consistent with self-similarity, and we present a hypothesized explanation for that self-similarity. Using a set of traces of actual user executions of NCSA Mosaic, we examine the dependence structure of WWW traffic. First, we show evidence that WWW traffic exhibits behavior that is consistent with self-similar traffic models. Then we show that the self-similarity in such traffic can be explained based on the underlying distributions of WWW document sizes, the effects of caching and user preference in file transfer, the effect of user &quot;think time&quot;, and the superimposition of many such transfers in a local-area network. To do this, we rely on empirically measured distributions both from client traces and from data independently collected at WWW servers.citations_number: 4783Citation: 2002): “Statistical mechanics of complex networks "Réka Albert" "Albert-László Barabási" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=97250f86fca0e2aa57af0c72c1f99bb4On power-law relationships of the Internet topology "Faloutsos, Michalis" "Faloutsos, Petros" "Faloutsos, Christos" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=055f1578db83ce79db880c4ddb875114Analyzing peer-to-peer traffic across large networks "Sen, Subhabrata" "Wang, Jia" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e0e42c6a56feb2853cb8f4dbc8f43eecReal life, real users, and real needs: a study and analysis of user queries on the web "Bernard J.
