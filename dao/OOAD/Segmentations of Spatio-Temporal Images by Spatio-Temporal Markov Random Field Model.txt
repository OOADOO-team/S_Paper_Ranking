name: Segmentations of Spatio-Temporal Images by Spatio-Temporal Markov Random Field Modelurl: http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-44745-8_20.pdfpublic_in: International Workshop on Energy Minimization Methods in Computer Vision &amp; Pattern Recognitionauthors: Shunsuke Kamijo,Katsushi Ikeuchi,Masao Sakauchi,abstract: Summary: There have been many successful researches on image segmentations that employ Markov Random Field model. However, most of them were interested in two-dimensional MRF, or spatial MRF, and very few researches are interested in three-dimensional MRF model. Generally, ‘three-dimensional’ has two meanings, i.e., spatially three-dimensional and spatio-temporal. In this paper, we especially are interested in segmentations of spatio-temporal images which appears to be equivalent to tracking problem of moving objects such as vehicles etc. For that purpose, by extending usual two-dimensional MRF, we defined a dedicated three-dimensional MRF which we defined as Spatio-Temporal MRF model (S-T MRF). This S-T MRF models a tracking problem by determining labels of groups of pixels by referring to their texture and labeling correlations along the temporal axis as well as the x-y image axes. Although vehicles severely occlude each other in general traffic images, segmentation boundries of vehicle regions will be determined precisely by this S-T MRF optimizing such boundaries through spatio-temporal images. Consequently, it was proved that the algorithm has performed 95\% success of tracking in midle-angle image at an intersection and 91\% success in low-angle and front-view images at a highway junction.citations_number: 38Citation: A Dynamic Hidden Markov Random Field Model for Foreground and Shadow Segmentation "Wang, Y" "Loe, K.
