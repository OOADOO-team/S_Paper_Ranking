name: Self-similarity through high-variability: statistical analysis of ethernet LAN traffic at the source levelurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/243768710_Statistical_Analysis_of_Ethernet_LAN_Traffic_at_the_Source_Levelpublic_in: 《IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking》authors: WILLINGER,Walter,abstract: A number of empirical studies of traffic measurements from a variety of working packet networks have demonstrated that actual network traffic is self-similar or long-range dependent in nature-in sharp contrast to commonly made traffic modeling assumptions. We provide a plausible physical explanation for the occurrence of self-similarity in local-area network (LAN) traffic. Our explanation is based on convergence results for processes that exhibit high variability and is supported by detailed statistical analyzes of real-time traffic measurements from Ethernet LANs at the level of individual sources. This paper is an extended version of Willinger et al. (1995). We develop here the mathematical results concerning the superposition of strictly alternating ON/OFF sources. Our key mathematical result states that the superposition of many ON/OFF sources (also known as packet-trains) with strictly alternating ON- and OFF-periods and whose ON-periods or OFF-periods exhibit the Noah effect produces aggregate network traffic that exhibits the Joseph effect. There is, moreover, a simple relation between the parameters describing the intensities of the Noah effect (high variability) and the Joseph effect (self-similarity). An extensive statistical analysis of high time-resolution Ethernet LAN traffic traces confirms that the data at the level of individual sources or source-destination pairs are consistent with the Noah effect. We also discuss implications of this simple physical explanation for the presence of self-similar traffic patterns in modern high-speed network trafficcitations_number: 2821Citation: 2002): “Statistical mechanics of complex networks "Réka Albert" "Albert-László Barabási" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=97250f86fca0e2aa57af0c72c1f99bb4Statistical mechanics of complex networks "Réka Albert" "AlbertLászló Barabási" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=09de58bced0f9e3d9cc6a9e1cf2dce65On power-law relationships of the Internet topology "Faloutsos, Michalis" "Faloutsos, Petros" "Faloutsos, Christos" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=055f1578db83ce79db880c4ddb875114Difficulties in simulating the Internet "Floyd, Sally" "Paxson, Vern" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=30ffa1e4fe66d515b03e95559fc7b24aIPACT a dynamic protocol for an Ethernet PON (EPON) "Kramer, G" "Mukherjee, B" "Pesavento, G" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bd518e19c4e7ff9ee1d3b0894d303a92BOOK REVIEW: Critical Phenomena in Natural Sciences: Chaos, Fractals, Selforganization and Disorder: Concepts and Tools "Sornette, D" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d8fed699a768b4201207c0e7f9b32b6Data networks as cascades: investigating the multifractal nature of Internet WAN traffic "Feldmann, A" "Gilbert, A.
