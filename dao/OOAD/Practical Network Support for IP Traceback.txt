name: Practical Network Support for IP Tracebackurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/220429779_Network_support_for_IP_traceback?ev=auth_pubpublic_in: 《IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking》authors: Stefan Savage,David Wetherall,Anna Karlin,abstract: This paper describes a technique for tracing anonymous packet flooding attacks in the Internet back toward their source. This work is motivated by the increased frequency and sophistication of denial-of-service attacks and by the difficulty in tracing packets with incorrect, or &amp;#8220;spoofed,&amp;#8221; source addresses. In this paper, we describe a general purpose traceback mechanism based on probabilistic packet marking in the network. Our approach allows a victim to identify the network path(s) traversed by attack traffic without requiring interactive operational support from Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Moreover, this traceback can be performed &amp;#8220;post mortem&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;after an attack has completed. We present an implementation of this technology that is incrementally deployable, (mostly) backward compatible, and can be efficiently implemented using conventional technology.citations_number: 2244Citation: Advanced and authenticated marking schemes for IP traceback "Dawn Xiaodong Song" "A.
