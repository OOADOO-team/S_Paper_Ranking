name: Wireless sensor network surveyurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/222648499_Wireless_sensor_network_surveypublic_in: Noneauthors: Jennifer Yick,Biswanath Mukherjee,Dipak Ghosal,abstract: A wireless sensor network (WSN) has important applications such as remote environmental monitoring and target tracking. This has been enabled by the availability, particularly in recent years, of sensors that are smaller, cheaper, and intelligent. These sensors are equipped with wireless interfaces with which they can communicate with one another to form a network. The design of a WSN depends significantly on the application, and it must consider factors such as the environment, the application’s design objectives, cost, hardware, and system constraints. The goal of our survey is to present a comprehensive review of the recent literature since the publication of [I.F. Akyildiz, W. Su, Y. Sankarasubramaniam, E. Cayirci, A survey on sensor networks, IEEE Communications Magazine, 2002]. Following a top-down approach, we give an overview of several new applications and then review the literature on various aspects of WSNs. We classify the problems into three different categories: (1) internal platform and underlying operating system, (2) communication protocol stack, and (3) network services, provisioning, and deployment. We review the major development in these three categories and outline new challenges.citations_number: 4589Citation: Energy conservation in wireless sensor networks: A survey "Giuseppe Anastasi" "Marco Conti" "Mario Di Francesco" "Andrea Passarella" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6f2b82a43be089edc1f76e1b37e95e51Energy-Efficient Routing Protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks: A Survey.
