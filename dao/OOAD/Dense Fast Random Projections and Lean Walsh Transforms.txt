name: Dense Fast Random Projections and Lean Walsh Transformsurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/225707657_Dense_Fast_Random_Projections_and_Lean_Walsh_Transformspublic_in: International Workshopauthors: Edo Liberty,Nir Ailon,Amit Singer,abstract: Summary: Random projection methods give distributions over $k \times d$ matrices such that if a matrix $Ψ$ (chosen according to the distribution) is applied to a vector $Ψ$ the norm of the resulting vector, $Ψx \in \Bbb R^k$, is up to distortion $ϵ$ equal to the norm of $x$ w.p. at least $1 - δ$. The Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma shows that such distributions exist over dense matrices for $k$ (the target dimension) in $O(\log (1/δ)/ε^2)$. Ailon and Chazelle and later Matousek showed that there exist entry-wise i.i.d. distributions over sparse matrices $Ψ$ which give the same guaranties for vectors whose $\ell _{ \infty }$ is bounded away from their $\ell _{2}$ norm. This allows to accelerate the mapping $x\mapsto Ψx$. We claim that setting $Ψ$ as any column normalized deterministic dense matrix composed with random $\pm 1$ diagonal matrix also exhibits this property for vectors whose $\ell _{p }$ (for any $p &gt; 2)$ is bounded away from their $\ell _{2}$ norm. We also describe a specific tensor product matrix which we term lean Walsh. It is applicable to any vector in $\Bbb R^d$ in $O(d)$ operations and requires a weaker $\ell _{ \infty }$ bound on $x$ then the best current result, under comparable running times, using sparse matrices due to Matousek.citations_number: 37Citation: Feature hashing for large scale multitask learning "Kilian Weinberger" "Anirban Dasgupta" "John Langford" "Alex Smola" "Josh Attenberg" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1aecbc0989430a16bca67bd61722f8c0Feature hashing for large scale multitask learning "Weinberger, Kilian" "Dasgupta, Anirban" "Langford, John" "Smola, Alex" "Attenberg, Josh" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=25548b9b58fdd9a5633b585606379259Randomized Algorithms for Matrices and Data "Michael W.
