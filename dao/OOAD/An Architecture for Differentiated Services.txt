name: An Architecture for Differentiated Servicesurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/4369109_An_Architecture_for_Differentiated_Security_Service?ev=prf_citpublic_in: International Symposium on Electronic Commerce &amp; Securityauthors: Davies, Elwyn,Carlson, Mark A,Weiss, Walter,abstract: Applications on network need not only enough quality of service (QoS) but also enough quality of security service (QoSS) because the security is essential for most of applications on network. The purpose of QoSS is to organize various security services together to achieve enough security for applications. As security requirements vary dramatically for different applications, differentiated security services (DSS) are necessary to realize the QoSS. This paper provides an architecture of DSS that is not only general enough to various types of scenarios, such as mobile communication and Internet communication, etc, but also compatible enough to current network solutions and technologies.citations_number: 204Citation: An Architecture for Differentiated Security Service "Jianyong Chen" "Xiaomin Wang" "Liwen He" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=627d37ef7bd4722cb98f83173728e01cA survey of techniques for internet traffic classification using machine learning "Thuy T.T.
