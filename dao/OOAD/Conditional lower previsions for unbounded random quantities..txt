name: Conditional lower previsions for unbounded random quantities.url: http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-34777-1_25.pdfpublic_in: International Workshop on Soft Methods for Integrated Uncertainty Modellingauthors: Troffaes, Matthias C.M,abstract: Abstract In this paper, a theory of conditional coherent lower previsions for arbitrary random quantities, including unbounded ones, is introduced, based on Williams’s [13] notion of coherence, and extending at the same time unconditional theories studied for unbounded random quantities known from the literature. We generalize a well-known envelope theorem to the domain of all contingent random quantities. Finally, using this duality result, we prove equivalence between maximal and Bayes actions in decision making for convex option sets.citations_number: 7Citation: A survey of the theory of coherent lower previsions "Miranda, Enrique" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d9355d08c202afb81ac3f7272d96c7cdWilliams coherence and beyond "Renato Pelessoni" "Paolo Vicig" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5a590a36d8a2673c0e902c7f697f997bProbability and time "Marco Zaffalon" "Enrique Miranda" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=863304e1b9fd814f5d3f83d9ecac724fWilliams coherence and beyond.
