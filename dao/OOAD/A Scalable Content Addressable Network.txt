name: A Scalable Content Addressable Networkurl: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=937250public_in: Noneauthors: Ratnasamy, Sylvia,Francis, Paul,Handley, Mark,abstract: Hash tables { which mapkeys &quot; onto values &quot; { are an essential building block in modern software systems. We believe a similar functionality would be equally valuable to large distributed systems. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a Content-Addressable Network (CAN) as a distributed infrastructure that provides hash table-like functionality onInternet-like scales. The CAN design is scalable, fault-tolerant and completely self-organizing, and we demonstrate its scalability, robustness and low-latency properties through simulation. 1.citations_number: 1Citation: Bigtable : A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data "CHANG" "Fay" "DEAN" "Jeffrey" "GHEMAWAT" "Sanjay" "HSIEH" "Wilson C" "WALLACH" "Deborah A" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=71f05334948e541a66987c1b76dd255cMeasurement study of peer-to-peer file sharing systems "Stefan Saroiu" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6f2157196feae4f527e4ffb2fc935e9bPeerTrust: Supporting Reputation-Based Trust for Peer-to-Peer Electronic Communities "Li Xiong" "Ling Liu" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b22d795820f090203a3e8523c192f731Scalable application layer multicast "Banerjee, Suman" "Bhattacharjee, Bobby" "Kommareddy, Christopher" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3ccbc216baab6e6efa676be5b180f66bScribe: a large-scale and decentralized application-level multicast infrastructure "Castro, Miguel" "Druschel, Peter" "Kermarrec, AnneMarie" "Rowstron, Antony I T" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3ea9e2de2f9e37c0ed40b9b7668f50a8SplitStream:high-bandwidth multicast in cooperative environments "Miguel Castro" "Peter Druschel" "Anne-Marie Kermarrec" "Animesh Nandi" "Antony Rowstron" "Atul Singh" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8dc25af42624d26fb14239e6d4621c6bPredicting Internet network distance with coordinates-based approaches "Ng, T.S.E" "Hui Zhang" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4ac276aca0d2effb500522bce9a16711Analyzing peer-to-peer traffic across large networks "Sen, Subhabrata" "Wang, Jia" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e0e42c6a56feb2853cb8f4dbc8f43eecReferences: SkipNet: a scalable overlay network with practical locality properties "Harvey, Nicholas J.
