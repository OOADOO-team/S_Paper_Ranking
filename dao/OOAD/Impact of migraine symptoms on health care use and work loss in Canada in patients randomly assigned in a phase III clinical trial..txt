name: Impact of migraine symptoms on health care use and work loss in Canada in patients randomly assigned in a phase III clinical trial.url: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12422253public_in: 《Can J Clin Pharmacol》authors: Lambert J,Carides GW,Meloche JP,abstract: Abstract BACKGROUND: Migraine is prevalent and associated with substantial direct and indirect costs that may vary across geographic and national boundaries. The effects of migraine, self-reported by Canadians, on health care resource use as well as paid and unpaid work loss were examined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Migraine Background Questionnaire (MBQ) was self-administered during the screening visit of a phase III clinical trial of rizatriptan (a potent, selective 5-hydroxytryptamine(1B/1D)-receptor agonist or &#039;triptan&#039;). Patients suffering from moderate to severe migraine in the previous six months were offered the opportunity to participate. Migraine frequency was determined and costs were estimated and assigned based on known direct costs of health care resource utilization, and indirect costs of paid and unpaid work and productivity loss. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-four patients completed the MBQ. In the previous year, 89% of those patients reported visiting a clinic, 23% reported visiting an emergency room and 5% reported being hospitalized for migraine. Patients reported an average of 6.5 days absent from work, 44 days working with migraine headache and 10.4 reduced workday equivalents due to ineffectiveness at work with migraine. Based on data obtained from the Ontario, the average overall annual cost due to migraine was estimated to be 3,025 dollars/patient; most of this (87%) due to indirect costs. CONCLUSION: In Canada, patients with moderate to severe migraine, as identified in a phase III clinical trial, reported lost work days and reduced effectiveness while at work, as well as increased health care resource utilization due to migraine. The associated cost was estimated to be substantial.citations_number: 13Citation: Traditional acupuncture in migraine: a controlled, randomized study "Facco E" "Liguori A" "Petti F" "Zanette G" "Coluzzi F" "De Nardin M" "Mattia C" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=03c4f7cf52af6335c21abfdb7f20a70eAssociation between lifestyle factors and headache "Winter Anke C" "Hoffmann Wolfgang" "Meisinger Christa" "Evers Stefan" "Vennemann Mechtild" "Pfaffenrath Volker" "Fendrich Konstanze" "Baumeister Sebastian E" "Kurth Tobias" "Berger Klaus" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4d95ed7a4d47bcf91ab99abe7a09bc8cDemographics and Clinical Features of Patients Referred to Headache Specialists "Jelinski, Susan E" "Becker, Werner J" "Christie, Suzanne N" "Giammarco, Rose" "Mackie, Gordon F" "Gawel, Marek J" "Eloff, Arnolda G" "Magnusson, Jane E" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=eff73505e50fdded2ccfcc4db6355612Canadian Headache Society systematic review and recommendations on the treatment of migraine pain in emergency settings "Orr SL" "Aubé M" "Becker WJ" "Davenport WJ" "Dilli E" "Dodick D" "Giammarco R" "Gladstone J" "Leroux E" "Pim H" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bc68fc97ce3e28d5d7d49054feedf732An economic evaluation of rizatriptan in the treatment of migraine "Thompson M" "Gawel M" "Desjardins B" "Ferko N" "Grima D" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4afc064b7f505797de1071c85263bd86Cost-effectiveness analysis of early versus non-early intervention in acute migraine based on evidence from the 'Act when Mild' study.
