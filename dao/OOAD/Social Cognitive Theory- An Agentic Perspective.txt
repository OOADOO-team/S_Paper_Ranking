name: Social Cognitive Theory: An Agentic Perspectiveurl: http://bjsm.bmj.com/external-ref?access_num=10.1146/annurev.psych.52.1.1&amp;link_type=DOIpublic_in: 《Asian Journal of Social Psychology》authors: Albert Bandura,abstract: This article presents the basic tenets of social cognitive theory. It is founded on a causal model of triadic reciprocal causation in which personal factors in the form of cognitive, affective and biological events, behavioral patterns, and environmental events all operate as interacting determinants that influence one another bidirectionally. Within this theory, human agency is embedded in a self theory encompassing self-organizing, proactive, self-reflective and self-regulative mechanisms. Human agency can be exercised through direct personal agency; through proxy agency relying on the efforts of intermediaries; and by collective agency operating through shared beliefs of efficacy, pooled understandings, group aspirations and incentive systems, and collective action. Personal agency operates within a broad network of sociostructural influences. In these agentic transactions, people are producers as well as products of social systems. Growing transnational imbeddedness and interdependence of societies are creating new social realities in which global forces increasingly interact with national ones to shape the nature of cultural life.citations_number: 2122Citation: Health promotion by social cognitive means "Bandura A" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=61bb25065d9fe54648b8f763a0431c07Audit and feedback: effects on professional practice and health care outcomes.
