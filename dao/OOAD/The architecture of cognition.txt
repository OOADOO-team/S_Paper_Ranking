name: The architecture of cognitionurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/247767835_The_Architecture_of_Cognitionpublic_in: Noneauthors: VanLehn, Kurt,abstract: Debates about systematicity originated with Fodor and Pylyshyn’s (1988) challenge to connectionist models of cognition in the 1980s (Hinton and Anderson 1981; Rumelhart and McClelland 1986; McClelland and Rumelhart 1986). They identified systematicity as a feature not just of language but also of thought in general, and argued that connectionist networks lacked the resources to account for it unless they implemented more traditional symbolic architectures. In the ensuing twenty-five years, connectionist or neural network models (as they are more commonly referred to today) have developed in a host of ways. Many of the most interesting models of cognitive capacities are ones that abandon the supervised framework of the backpropagation learning algorithm that figured centrally in the 1980s and employ units that more closely resemble actual neurons (Maass, Natschläger, and Markram 2003; Eliasmith et al. 2012). The debates between connectionists and symbolic theorists have largely disappeared from cognitive science itself. The main contemporary debate is between Bayesian optimality models (Griffiths et al. 2010) and connectionists who adopt an emergentist approach (McClelland et al. 2010). Systematicity has thus been left as an issue for philosophers. In part, this is because much of contemporary cognitive science has focused on phenomena (sensory processing and categorization, working memory, motor control, decision making) for which systematicity has appeared to be less central. It is further the result of an implicit assumption among neural network modelers that where systematicity is an issue, they can invoke the same emergentist perspective they adopt toward Bayesian models: systematicity too can be accounted for as an emergent property of underlying simpler neural network processes. We contend that this is a mistake on both counts. Systematicity applies to cognition beyond language processing; we will discuss it in the context of sensory processing and related processes of categorization. We will begin, however, with 7 Systematicity and the Need for Encapsulated Representations Gideon Borensztajn, Willem Zuidema, and William Bechtel 166 Gideon Borensztajn, Willem Zuidema, and William Bechtel language processing, arguing that the emergentist perspective seriously impoverishes the neural network approach. By neglecting the role of representations that encapsulate information and can be operated on while remaining invariant to contextual factors, the emergentist thread in neural network approaches denies itself the resources needed to capture systematic components of cognition. Although there have been important neural network models that do not eschew encapsulated representations (Grossberg 1982; Miikkulainen 1993), for many proponents and opponents of neural networks the fundamental commitment seems to be to associationist processing in which associations between all units are learned through the gradual strengthening or weakening of their weights. We argue, however, that this should not be the core commitment of the neural network approach and, in many contexts, should be abandoned. Rather, the fundamental commitment should be a constraint imposed on modeling cognitive behavior, restricting what interpretations are permitted of the primitive units of the system. Such interpretations must depend exclusively on internal, autonomously executed processes, and not imposed externally or globally. In other words, all interactions must be local, and all meanings must eventually be grounded in the external input to the network. This constraint rules out symbolic rules with variables, but does not prohibit operations over encapsulated representations (representations not directly affected by processing elsewhere in the system). Encapsulated units share with variables that they can act as placeholders and bind to appropriate units on their inputs. They are different in that the extensional scope of a variable is globally specified in advance, whereas the extensional scope and meaning of an encapsulated representation is learnablecitations_number: 6262Citation: A Dynamic Theory of Organizational Knowledge Creation "Ikujiro Nonaka" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=762cbd4ae1109f7f94da8191f62d416aAn integrative theory of prefrontal cortex function.
