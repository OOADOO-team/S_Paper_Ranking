name: Faster R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networksurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/277722488_Faster_R-CNN_Towards_Real-Time_Object_Detection_with_Region_Proposal_Networkspublic_in: Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems - Volume 1authors: Ren, Shaoqing,He, Kaiming,Girshick, Ross,abstract: Abstract:  State-of-the-art object detection networks depend on region proposal algorithms to hypothesize object locations. Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with &#039;attention&#039; mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks.
