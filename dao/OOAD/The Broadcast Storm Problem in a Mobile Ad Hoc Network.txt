name: The Broadcast Storm Problem in a Mobile Ad Hoc Networkurl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1013763825347public_in: Wireless Networksauthors: Yu-Chee Tseng, Sze-Yao Ni, Yuh-Shyan Chen,abstract: Broadcasting is a common operation in a network to resolve many issues. In a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) in particular, due to host mobility, such operations are expected to be executed more frequently (such as finding a route to a particular host, paging a particular host, and sending an alarm signal). Because radio signals are likely to overlap with others in a geographical area, a straightforward broadcasting by flooding is usually very costly and will result in serious redundancy, contention, and collision, to which we call the broadcast storm problem. In this paper, we identify this problem by showing how serious it is through analyses and simulations. We propose several schemes to reduce redundant rebroadcasts and differentiate timing of rebroadcasts to alleviate this problem. Simulation results are presented, which show different levels of improvement over the basic flooding approach.citations_number: 4548Citation: Comparison of broadcasting techniques for mobile ad hoc networks "Brad Williams" "Tracy Camp" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6871a3b5e28749b77ffc38750713eb07Gossip-based ad hoc routing "Haas, Zygmunt" "Halpern, Joseph Y" "Li, Li" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4b7ae08a392ecd0ebf95ede75d069457Mobile Ad Hoc Networking with a View of 4G Wireless: Imperatives and Challenges "Liu, Jennifer J.‐N" "Chlamtac, Imrich" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=18998594e4533d1c84e28e34f3c3c1bfDTN routing as a resource allocation problem "Aruna Balasubramanian" "Brian Levine" "Arun Venkataramani" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=295b5cf11d79d0391e8cefefbf4ed091Dominating Sets and Neighbor Elimination-Based Broadcasting Algorithms in Wireless Networks "Ivan Stojmenovic" "Mahtab Seddigh" "Jovisa Zunic" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f7f6a3d27fa31b2ed891e4c17d52728fMultipoint relaying for flooding broadcast messages in mobile wireless networks "A.
