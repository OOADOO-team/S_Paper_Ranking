name: Knowledge Transfer in Intraorganizational Networks : Effects of Network Position and Absorptive Capacity on Business Unit Innovation and Performanceurl: http://www.jstor.org/stable/3069443public_in: 《Academy of Management Journal》authors: TSAI,W,abstract: Drawing on a network perspective on organizational learning, I argue that organizational units can produce more innovations and enjoy better performance if they occupy central network positions that provide access to new knowledge developed by other units. This effect, however, depends on units&#039; absorptive capacity, or ability to successfully replicate new knowledge. Data from 24 business units in a petrochemical company and 36 business units in a food-manufacturing company show that the interaction between absorptive capacity and network position has significant, positive effects on business unit innovation and performance.citations_number: 3525Citation: Network Structure and Knowledge Transfer: The Effects of Cohesion and Range "Ray Reagans" "Bill McEvily" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dfe557b529e591fe94c5fc0ba78399fbThe Network Paradigm in Organizational Research: A Review and Typology "Stephen P.
