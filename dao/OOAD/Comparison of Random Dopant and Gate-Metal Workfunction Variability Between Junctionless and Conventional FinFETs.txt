name: Comparison of Random Dopant and Gate-Metal Workfunction Variability Between Junctionless and Conventional FinFETsurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/262572565_Comparison_of_Random_Dopant_and_Gate-Metal_Workfunction_Variability_Between_Junctionless_and_Conventional_FinFETspublic_in: 《IEEE Electron Device Letters》authors: S.M. Nawaz,S. Dutta,A. Chattopadhyay,abstract: This letter reports, for the first time, the performance of a junctionless (JL) FinFET in the presence of random grain orientation-induced metal workfunction variability (WFV), as compared with a similarly sized conventional FinFET. Relative impact of random discrete dopant (RDD)-induced variability and WFV are also compared between such devices by the use of a 3-D numerical device simulator. Numerical values of standard deviation of different device parameters reveal that the performance parameters of a JL FinFET are significantly affected by WFV. In addition, the impact of the RDD, as compared with WFV, is larger in JL devices, as expected.citations_number: 2Citation: Simulation Analysis of Hafnium-based-Oxide and Effects of Metallization on Electrical Performance of Gate-All-Around Finfet Devices ☆ "M.
