name: Negotiation-Based Protocols for Disseminating Information in Wireless Sensor Networksurl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1013715909417public_in: Wireless Networksauthors: Joanna Kulik,Wendi Heinzelman,Hari Balakrishnan,abstract: In this paper, we present a family of adaptive protocols, called SPIN (Sensor Protocols for Information via Negotiation), that efficiently disseminate information among sensors in an energy-constrained wireless sensor network. Nodes running a SPIN communication protocol name their data using high-level data descriptors, called meta-data. They use meta-data negotiations to eliminate the transmission of redundant data throughout the network. In addition, SPIN nodes can base their communication decisions both upon application-specific knowledge of the data and upon knowledge of the resources that are available to them. This allows the sensors to efficiently distribute data given a limited energy supply. We simulate and analyze the performance of four specific SPIN protocols: SPIN-PP and SPIN-EC, which are optimized for a point-to-point network, and SPIN-BC and SPIN-RL, which are optimized for a broadcast network. Comparing the SPIN protocols to other possible approaches, we find that the SPIN protocols can deliver 60% more data for a given amount of energy than conventional approaches in a point-to-point network and 80% more data for a given amount of energy in a broadcast network. We also find that, in terms of dissemination rate and energy usage, the SPIN protocols perform close to the theoretical optimum in both point-to-point and broadcast networks.citations_number: 2199Citation: Secure routing in wireless sensor networks: attacks and countermeasures "C.
