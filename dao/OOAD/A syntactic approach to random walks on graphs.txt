name: A syntactic approach to random walks on graphsurl: http://link.springer.com/10.1007/BFb0024503public_in: International Workshop on Graph-theoretic Concepts in Computer Scienceauthors: M. Mosbah,N. Saheb,abstract: We use formal language theory to study syntactic behaviour of random walks on graphs. The set of walks, viewed as sets of words, is a recognizable language. As a consequence, a set of random walks can be formally described by a rational fraction or equivalently by an automaton. Applying these techniques, we compute in a unified way various statistical parameters related to random walks, such as mean cover time, and the mean hitting time.citations_number: 4Citation: Markovian workload modeling for Enterprise Application Servers "Nima Sharifimehr" "Samira Sadaoul" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6906fea07a382c7b204d351fc932c93eFormal rational fractions and random walks on cycles "M.
