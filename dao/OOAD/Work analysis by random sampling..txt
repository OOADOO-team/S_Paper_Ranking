name: Work analysis by random sampling.url: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/626793public_in: 《Bulletin of the Medical Library Association》authors: J L Divilbiss,P C Self,abstract: Random sampling of work activities using an electronic random alarm mechanism provided a simple and effective way to determine how time was divided between various activities. At each random alarm the subject simply recorded the time and the activity.
