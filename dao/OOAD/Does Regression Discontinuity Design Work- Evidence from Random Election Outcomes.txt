name: Does Regression Discontinuity Design Work? Evidence from Random Election Outcomesurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/315334168_Does_Regression_Discontinuity_Design_Work_Evidence_from_Random_Election_Outcomespublic_in: 《General Information》authors: Ari Hyytinen,Jaakko Merillinen,Tuukka Saarimaa,abstract: We use elections data in which a large number of ties in vote counts between candidates are resolved via a lottery to study the personal incumbency advantage. We benchmark non-experimental RDD estimates against the estimate produced by this experiment that takes place exactly at the cutoff. The experimental estimate suggests that there is no personal incumbency advantage. In contrast, conventional local polynomial RDD estimates suggest a moderate and statistically significant effect. Bias-corrected RDD estimates applying robust inference are, however, in line with the experimental estimate. Therefore, state-of-the-art implementation of RDD can meet the replication standard in the context of close elections.citations_number: 5Citation: Local favoritism in at-large proportional representation systems * "Jon H.
