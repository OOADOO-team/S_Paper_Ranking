name: Uniform random walks in very large modelsurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/228932022_Uniform_random_walks_in_very_large_modelspublic_in: International Workshop on Random Testing: Co-located with the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineeringauthors: Johan Oudinet,abstract: This paper presents first experimental results on uniform random generation of paths in very large graphs that model concurrent systems, as it was presented in [3]. The approach is based on techniques and tools for counting and drawing uniformly at random in combinatorial structures. It exploits the fact that in a system made of several concurrent components, local uniform drawings of component paths can be combined into a very good approximation of uniform drawing of paths in the global system, without constructing the global model. The paper describes some implementation of the methods presented in [3], reports results on a first suite of benchmarks, exploring the limits and the possibility of this new approach to uniform random walks.citations_number: 24Citation: Uniform Monte-Carlo model checking "Johan Oudinet" "Alain Denise" "Marie-Claude Gaudel" "Richard Lassaigne" "Sylvain Peyronnet" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1b4324d5769e5805a5c897668b3dd45eCoverage-biased Random Exploration of Models "Marie-Claude Gaudel" "Alain Denise" "Sandrine-Dominique Gouraud" "Richard Lassaigne" "Johan Oudinet" "Sylvain Peyronnet" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fa133187659a977b7d472f207beb96e8Counting for random testing "Marie-Claude Gaudel" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2a2123f378588888ab51774dd5446b0bEmpirical evaluation of the fault detection effectiveness and test effort efficiency of the automated AOP testing approaches "Reza Meimandi Parizi" "Abdul Azim Abdul Ghani" "Rusli Abdullah" "Rodziah Atan" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2120cfd2042891fd1974a9aefe8c5c8fSynchronization of Bernoulli sequences on shared letters "Samy Abbes" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3d0f90d34f97e412c739c13a2ae080e8Alg\`ebre combinatoire et effective: des graphes aux alg\`ebres de Kac, via l'exploration informatique "Nicolas M.
