Network analysisurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/3077706_A_calculus_for_network_delay_II_Network_analysispublic_in: IEEE Transactions on Information Theoryauthors: Rene L Cruz,abstract: For pt.I see ibid., vol.37, no.1, p.114-31 (1991). A method to analyze the flow of data in a network consisting of the interconnection of network elements is presented. Assuming the data that enters the network satisfies burstiness constraints, burstiness constraints are derived for traffic flowing between network elements. These derived constraints imply bounds on network delay and buffering requirements. By example, it is shown that the use of regulator elements within the network can reduce maximum network delay. It is also found that such a use of regulator elements can enlarge the throughput region where finite bounds for delay are found. Finally, it is shown how regulator elements connected in series can be used to enforce general burstiness constraintscitations_number: 2502Citation: Generalized processor sharing approach to flow control in integrated services networks: The multiple node case "Parekh, Abhay K" "Gallager, Robert G" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f36832a0ca71422c2477ed4a4cb198d0A calculus for network delay.
