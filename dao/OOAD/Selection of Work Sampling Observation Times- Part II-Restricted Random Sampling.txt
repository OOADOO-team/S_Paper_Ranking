AIIE Transactionsauthors: J. J. Moder, H. D. Kahn,abstract: The problem of sampling from a finite population defined on the interval (1,2, ... , T) is considered, using a restricted form of random sampling in which the spacing between consecutive observations must be at least some minimum value, M. For this kind of restricted random sample, of size N, the value M can be arbitrarily designated in the range from zero, corresponding to simple random sampling with replacement, to a maximum of T/N, corresponding to systematic sampling. An efficient procedure is formulated for generating a sample for specified values of N, M, and T. It is then illustrated by computer simulation that values of M in the range from 60-90% of T/N retain most of the advantages of systematic sampling, while avoiding most of the disadvantages for some special processes. In addition, the error variance associated with stratified sampling is comparable to restricted random sampling with a minimum spacing of about 70%, and both techniques are practically as efficient as systematic sampling. In effect, it can be concluded that the modified exponential sampling procedure outlined is an efficient way of generating restricted random sampling observation times with minimum spacing over the complete range from 0-100%.
