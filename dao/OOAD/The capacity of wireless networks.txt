name: The capacity of wireless networksurl: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2266070public_in: Noneauthors: Gupta, Piyush,Kumar, P.R,abstract: When n identical randomly located nodes, each capable of transmitting at W bits per second and using a fixed range, form a wireless network, the throughput /spl lambda/(n) obtainable by each node for a randomly chosen destination is /spl Theta/(W//spl radic/(nlogn)) bits per second under a noninterference protocol. If the nodes are optimally placed in a disk of unit area, traffic patterns are optimally assigned, and each transmission&#039;s range is optimally chosen, the bit-distance product that can be transported by the network per second is /spl Theta/(W/spl radic/An) bit-meters per second. Thus even under optimal circumstances, the throughput is only /spl Theta/(W//spl radic/n) bits per second for each node for a destination nonvanishingly far away. Similar results also hold under an alternate physical model where a required signal-to-interference ratio is specified for successful receptions. Fundamentally, it is the need for every node all over the domain to share whatever portion of the channel it is utilizing with nodes in its local neighborhood that is the reason for the constriction in capacity. Splitting the channel into several subchannels does not change any of the results. Some implications may be worth considering by designers. Since the throughput furnished to each user diminishes to zero as the number of users is increased, perhaps networks connecting smaller numbers of users, or featuring connections mostly with nearby neighbors, may be more likely to be find acceptance.citations_number: 8878Citation: Wireless mesh networks: a survey "Weilin Wang" "Weilin Wang" "Weilin Wang" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3e0ac7b7c9c6df5bd7901d4a1998294eOn the achievable throughput of a multiantenna Gaussian broadcast channel "Caire, Giuseppe" "Shamai, Shlomo" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3a1ee47f3b78e3878bf0669cbc28b6ecFading relay channels: Performance limits and space-time signal design "Nabar, Rohit U" "Bölcskei, Helmut" "Kneubühler, Felix W" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=903ad5773040c9e3a2f65bf1edd147b6An energy efficient hierarchical clustering algorithm for wireless sensor networks "Bandyopadhyay, Seema" "Coyle, Edward J" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8227a0fb9df22d7b0819447730c521aaImpact of Interference on Multi-Hop Wireless Network Performance "Kamal Jain" "Jitendra Padhye" "Venkata N.
