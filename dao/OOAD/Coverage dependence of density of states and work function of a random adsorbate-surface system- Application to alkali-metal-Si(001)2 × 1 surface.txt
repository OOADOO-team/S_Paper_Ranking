name: Coverage dependence of density of states and work function of a random adsorbate-surface system: Application to alkali-metal/Si(001)2 × 1 surfaceurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0039602889900630public_in: Surface Scienceauthors: Kato Tomohiko, Ohtomi Ken-Ichi, Nakayama Masatoshi,abstract: A cell-CPA theory is developed for a random adsorbate-substrate system based on the LCAO model. Effects of the adsorbate-substrate and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions and the depolarization shifts of the adsorbate level are treated self-consistently. Short-range correlation in the adsorbate distribution is taken into account. The theory is applied to alkali metals adsorbed on the silicon (001) surface. Local density of states, charge transfer, and the change of the work function are calculated and illustrated as a function of the coverage. The calculated coverage dependence of the work function of the Cs/Si(001) system agrees fairly well with the experimental results. The nature of the adsorbate-substrate bonding is analyzed. The bonding is almost ionic at low coverage, while the covalent character increases with coverage, as the adsorbate levels come down due to the depolarization shift and the lateral interaction among the adsorbates. The transition is sensitive to the inter-adsorbate correlation. An effect of the nonorthogonality between the adsorbate and substrate orbitals is briefly discussed.citations_number: 19Citation: The bonding of alkali metals to semiconductor surfaces: a direct and inverse photoemission study "B.
