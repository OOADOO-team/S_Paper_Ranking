name: Dynamic fine-grained localization in Ad-Hoc network of sensorsurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/220926176_Dynamic_fine-grainedpublic_in: International Conference on Mobile Computing &amp; Networkingauthors: SAVVIDES,A,abstract: The recent advances in radio and em beddedsystem technologies have enabled the proliferation of wireless microsensor networks. Such wirelessly connected sensors are released in many diverse environments to perform various monitoring tasks. In many such tasks, location awareness is inherently one of the most essential system parameters. It is not only needed to report the origins of events, but also to assist group querying of sensors, routing, and to answer questions on the network coverage. In this paper we present a novel approach to the localization of sensors in an ad-hoc network. We describe a system called AHLoS (Ad-Hoc Localization System) that enables sensor nodes to discover their locations using a set distributed iterative algorithms. The operation of AHLoS is demonstrated with an accuracy of a few centimeters using our prototype testbed while scalability and performance are studied through simulation.citations_number: 3886Citation: Range-free localization schemes for large scale sensor networks "Tian He" "Chengdu Huang" "Brian M.
