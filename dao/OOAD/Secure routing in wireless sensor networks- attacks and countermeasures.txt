name: Secure routing in wireless sensor networks: attacks and countermeasuresurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/4017396_Secure_routing_in_wireless_sensor_networks_attacks_and_countermeasurespublic_in: Proceedings of the First IEEE International Workshop on Sensor Network Protocols and Applications, 2003.authors: C. Karlof,D. Wagner,abstract: We consider routing security in wireless sensor networks. Many sensor network routing protocols have been proposed, but none of them have been designed with security as a goal. We propose security goals for routing in sensor networks, show how attacks against ad-hoc and peer-to-peer networks can be adapted into powerful attacks against sensor networks, introduce two classes of novel attacks against sensor networks sinkholes and HELLO floods, and analyze the security of all the major sensor network routing protocols. We describe crippling attacks against all of them and suggest countermeasures and design considerations. This is the first such analysis of secure routing in sensor networks.citations_number: 2283Citation: Secure routing in wireless sensor networks: attacks and countermeasures "C. Karlof" "D.
