name: 3-D net work numerical modeling technique for random discontinuities of rock massurl: http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-YTGC200104002.htmpublic_in: 《Chinese Jounal of Geotechnical Engineering》authors: J.P. Chen,abstract: D net work numerical modeling technique for discontinuities of rock mass is a new technique developed recently, which can be a very important basic work to evaluate the stability and geometric parameters for engineering design in jointed rock mass. The technique is based on the in situ investigation of discontinuity traces in sampling window, with the application of probabilistic statistics, stochastic, mont carlo simulation and computer programming, to correct the bias of orientation, trace, spacing from sampling window,and finally,3 D net work numerical model for discontinuities is formed.citations_number: 50Citation: Seepape-stress coupled model of heterogeneous and random fractured rock mass "ZHANG Chun-hui" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d541384594303bbb86b32bfa57c395b1Permeability tensor and representative elementary volume of fractured;rock masses "Liu" "Guang" "Hou" "Di" "Rong" "Peng" "Wang" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0fa63ba0eb08ba5570fd44869494a30eCOMPOSITE ELEMENT METHOD FOR SEEPAGE CHARACTERISTICS STUDY ON ROCK MASSES WITH COMPLICATED FRACTURE NETWORK "FENG Xuemin" "CHEN Shenghong" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c1ed7547d5c9eccd9453e50aacce53b6Determination of Geometrical and Structural Representative Volume Elements at the Baihetan Dam Site "Wen Zhang" "Jian-ping Chen" "Chang Liu" "Rui Huang" "Ming Li" "Ying Zhang" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1b793f2bec205e42377a2673aca92677Numerical simulation of grouting in space fracture network of rock mass "LUO Ping-ping" "CHEN Lei" "ZOU Zheng-sheng" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e8de5e28dc32a03fcc7edd4f8ca08c0eAPPLICATION OF GENETIC ALGORITHM TO EVALUATE 3D PERSISTENCE OF JOINTED ROCK MASS "Lu Bo" "Chen Jianping" "Shi Bingfei" "Cheng Yonghui" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a51d5d6d333ff1d9e096186ab99c25f6OBTAINING RQD OF ROCK MASS BY SAMPLING WINDOW METHOD "Chen Jianping" "Wang Qing" "Zhao Hongliang" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=446ff49012e5e6807b794be272679d29DETERMINING THREE-DIMENSIONAL CONNECTIVITY OF ROCK MASS DISCONTINUITY BY PROJECTION "CHEN Jian-ping" "LU Bo" "GU Xian-min" "FAN Jian-hua" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f9c7799420fd1b955e6781485cb0dc48Generation and verification of three-dimensional network of fractured rock masses stochastic discontinuities based on digitalization "Liang Guo" "Xiaozhao Li" "Yangyi Zhou" "Yangsong Zhang" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=03f66a2ca9036b696ef1017ecf032739Program for joint network simulation and its application to dynamic response analysis of underground caverns "JIA Chao" "WANG Zhi-peng" "ZHU Wei-shen" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7cb23caa7c93d18015be96836088a6a8References: 岩体稳定分析的赤平投影方法 "石根华" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=92d6c55e659e0a1dadd200826c6e2bf3岩体稳定分析的几何方法 "石根华" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2a36d55fe913c3adf4131f25860e46feEVALUATION OF STATISTICAL HOMOGENEITY OF ROCK MASS STRUCTURE "Chen Jianping" "Wang Qing" "Xiao Shufang" "Teng Jianren" "PHSWKulatilake" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f243e1d323101e9478f69e5c33e5ebc6PROBABILITY ESTIMATION OF MEAN TRACE LENGTH OF DISCONTINUITIES AND ITS APPLICATION "Chen Jianping" "Wang Qing" "Xiao Shufang" "Teng Jianren" "P H" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=54592ada19d6c32fbae2d20d964a7a08AN APPLICATION OF CHI-SQUARE TEST VALIDITY OF ASSUMED DISTRIBUTION IN THE ENGINEERING GEOLOGY "Chen Jianping" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=967b10e32196262e0c471b61a8e4c0cc
