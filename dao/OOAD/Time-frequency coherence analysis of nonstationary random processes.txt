name: Time-frequency coherence analysis of nonstationary random processesurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2315129_Time-Frequency_Coherence_Analysis_Of_Nonstationary_Random_Processespublic_in: IEEE Workshop on Statistical Signal &amp; Array Processingauthors: Matz, G,Hlawatsch, F,abstract: The coherence function is extended to nonstationary random processes through the introduction and investigation of a coherence operator and time-frequency (TF) coherence functions. For underspread nonstationary processes, it is shown that TF coherence functions are a meaningful tool for nonstationary coherence analysis and that they provide approximate TF formulations of the coherence operatorcitations_number: 24Citation: On non-WSSUS wireless fading channels "G.
