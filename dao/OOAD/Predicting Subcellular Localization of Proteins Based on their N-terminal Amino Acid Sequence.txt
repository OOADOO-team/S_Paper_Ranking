name: Predicting Subcellular Localization of Proteins Based on their N-terminal Amino Acid Sequenceurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_JJ025553996public_in: Journal of Molecular Biologyauthors: Olof Emanuelsson, Henrik Nielsen, S?ren Brunak,abstract: A neural network-based tool, TargetP, for large-scale subcellular location prediction of newly identified proteins has been developed. Using N-terminal sequence information only, it discriminates between proteins destined for the mitochondrion, the chloroplast, the secretory pathway, and &quot;other&quot; localizations with a success rate of 85 % (plant) or 90 % (non-plant) on redundancy-reduced test sets. From a TargetP analysis of the recently sequenced Arabidopsis thaliana chromosomes 2 and 4 and the Ensembl Homo sapiens protein set, we estimate that 10 % of all plant proteins are mitochondrial and 14 % chloroplastic, and that the abundance of secretory proteins, in both Arabidopsis and Homo, is around 10 %. TargetP also predicts cleavage sites with levels of correctly predicted sites ranging from approximately 40 % to 50 % (chloroplastic and mitochondrial presequences) to above 70 % (secretory signal peptides). TargetP is available as a web-server at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/.citations_number: 4105Citation: Analysis of the genome sequence of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana.
