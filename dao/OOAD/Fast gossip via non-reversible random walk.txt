name: Fast gossip via non-reversible random walkurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/4243612_Fast_Gossip_via_Non-reversible_Random_Walkpublic_in: IEEE Information Theory Workshopauthors: Kyomin Jung, Devavrat Shah,abstract: Distributed computation of average is essential for many tasks such as estimation, eigenvalue computation, scheduling in the context of wireless sensor and ad-hoc networks. The wireless communication imposes the gossip constraint: each node can communicate with at most one other node at a given time. Recent interest in emerging wireless sensor network has led to exciting developments in the context of gossip algorithms for averaging. Most of the known algorithms are iterative and based on certain reversible random walk on the network graph. Subsequently, the running time of algorithm is affected by the diffusive nature of reversible random walk. For example, they take Î©(n2) time to compute average on a simple path or ring graph of n nodes. In contrast, an optimal (simple) centralized algorithm takes [unk](n) time to compute average in a path. This raises the following questions: is it possible for a distributed algorithm to compute average in O(n) time for path graph? is it possible to improve over diffusive behavior of current algorithms in arbitrary graphs? In this paper, we answer the above questions in affirmative. To overcome the diffusive nature of algorithms, we utilize non-reversible random walks. Specifically, we design our algorithms by &quot;projecting down&quot; the &quot;lifted&quot; non-reversible random walks of Diaconis-Holmes-Neal (2000) and Chen-Lovasz-Pak (1999). The running time of our algorithm is square-root of the time taken by corresponding reversible random walk for a large class of graphs including path.citations_number: 23Citation: Maximizing throughput in wireless networks via gossiping "Eytan Modiano" "Devavrat Shah" "Gil Zussman" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=21fd6e761e9a396119a9682079856e46Polynomial Filtering for Fast Convergence in Distributed Consensus "Kokiopoulou, E" "Frossard, P" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=58de697cfcf4f6f869e71624a3bea173Beyond random walk and metropolis-hastings samplers: why you should not backtrack for unbiased graph sampling "Chul-Ho Lee" "Xin Xu" "Do Young Eun" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8590bd00bed2e8552f930ea21197fa8dA Partition-Tolerant Manycast Algorithm for Disaster Area Networks "Mikael Asplund" "Simin Nadjm-Tehrani" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6dd2b85b1fee35cddf198a8704638c92Location-Aided Fast Distributed Consensus in Wireless Networks "Wenjun Li" "Huaiyu Dai" "Yanbing Zhang" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7f1b8a5a70b8a3f1694d1f4961b3ae61Accelerating Distributed Consensus Via Lifting Markov Chains "Wenjun Li" "Huaiyu Dai" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4a31f560d57dcbcaa52cbaed86da062bLocation-Aided Fast Distributed Consensus "Wenjun Li" "Huaiyu Dai" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bf97963c5680922caef832106f2e98adLocation-Aided Fast Distributed Averaging "Wenjun Li" "Huaiyu Dai" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a0ff868b40282228b57c3166a637d54eFast and Distributed Computation of Schedules in Wireless Networks "S.
