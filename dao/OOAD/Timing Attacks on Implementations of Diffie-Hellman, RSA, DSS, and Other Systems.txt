name: Timing Attacks on Implementations of Diffie-Hellman, RSA, DSS, and Other Systemsurl: http://link.springer.com/10.1007/3-540-68697-5_9public_in: International Cryptology Conference on Advances in Cryptologyauthors: Paul C. Kocher,abstract: By carefully measuring the amount of time required to perform private key operations, attackers may be able to find fixed Diffie-Hellman exponents, factor RSA keys, and break other cryptosystems. Against a vulnerable system, the attack is computationally inexpensive and often requires only known ciphertext. Actual systems are potentially at risk, including cryptographic tokens, network-based cryptosystems, and other applications where attackers can make reasonably accurate timing measurements. Techniques for preventing the attack for RSA and Diffie-Hellman are presented. Some cryptosystems will need to be revised to protect against the attack, and new protocols and algorithms may need to incorporate measures to prevent timing attacks.citations_number: 1088Citation: Universally Composable Security: A New Paradigm for Cryptographic Protocols "R.
