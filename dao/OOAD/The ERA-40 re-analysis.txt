name: The ERA-40 re-analysisurl: http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/3/034001/refs/22/doipublic_in: Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Societyauthors: abstract: ERA-40 is a re-analysis of meteorological observations from  September 1957 to August 2002 produced by the European Centre for  Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in collaboration with many  institutions. The observing system changed considerably over this  re-analysis period, with assimilable data provided by a succession of  satellite-borne instruments from the 1970s onwards, supplemented by  increasing numbers of observations from aircraft, ocean-buoys and other  surface platforms, but with a declining number of radiosonde ascents  since the late 1980s. The observations used in ERA-40 were accumulated  from many sources. The first part of this paper describes the data  acquisition and the principal changes in data type and coverage over the  period. It also describes the data assimilation system used for ERA-40.  This benefited from many of the changes introduced into operational forecasting since the mid-1990s, when the systems used for the 15-year ECMWF re-analysis (ERA-15) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) re-analysis were implemented. Several of the improvements are discussed.  General aspects of the production of the analyses are also summarized. A  number of results indicative of the overall performance of the data  assimilation system, and implicitly of the observing system, are  presented and discussed. The comparison of background (short-range)  forecasts and analyses with observations, the consistency of the global  mass budget, the magnitude of differences between analysis and  background fields and the accuracy of medium-range forecasts run from  the ERA-40 analyses are illustrated. Several results demonstrate the  marked improvement that was made to the observing system for the  southern hemisphere in the 1970s, particularly towards the end of the  decade. In contrast, the synoptic quality of the analysis for the  northern hemisphere is sufficient to provide forecasts that remain  skilful well into the medium range for all years. Two particular  problems are also examined: excessive precipitation over tropical oceans  and a too strong Brewer-Dobson circulation, both of which are pronounced  in later years. Several other aspects of the quality of the re-analyses  revealed by monitoring and validation studies are summarized.  Expectations that the &#039;second-generation&#039; ERA-40 re-analysis would  provide products that are better than those from the first-generation  ERA-15 and NCEP/NCAR re-analyses are found to have been met in most  casescitations_number: 5555Citation: The ERA‐Interim reanalysis: configuration and performance of the data assimilation system "Dee, D.
