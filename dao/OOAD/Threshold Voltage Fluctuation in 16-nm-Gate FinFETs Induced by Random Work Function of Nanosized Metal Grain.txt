name: Threshold Voltage Fluctuation in 16-nm-Gate FinFETs Induced by Random Work Function of Nanosized Metal Grainurl: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22905489public_in: 《J Nanosci Nanotechnol》authors: Li, Yiming,Cheng, HuiWen,Hwang, ChiHong,abstract: Abstract The random work-function (WK) induced threshold voltage fluctuation (sigmaVth) in 16 nm Titanium Nitride (TiN) metal-gate fin-type field effect transistors (FinFETs) is explored and modeled by using an experimentally validated Monte Carlo simulation approach. The influences of metal-grain size and device geometry aspect ratio on the random WK-induced sigmaVth are considered in the proposed equation analytically. The formula accounts for the inside of fluctuation and could be used for the assessment of effectiveness of suppression techniques.citations_number: 1Citation: 可管可控P2P覆盖网管理方法研究 "" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=11d76c184f60aa71654410f359e7d7a7References: Process Technology Variation "Kelin J.
