name: Linear network codingurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/3084630_public_in: IEEE Transactions on Information Theoryauthors: Li, S.-Y.R., Yeung, R.W., Ning Cai,abstract: Consider a communication network in which certain source nodes  multicast information to other nodes on the network in the multihop fashion where every node can pass on any of its received data to others.  We are interested in how fast each node can receive the complete  information, or equivalently, what the information rate arriving at each  node is. Allowing a node to encode its received data before passing it  on, the question involves optimization of the multicast mechanisms at  the nodes. Among the simplest coding schemes is linear coding, which  regards a block of data as a vector over a certain base field and allows  a node to apply a linear transformation to a vector before passing it  on. We formulate this multicast problem and prove that linear coding  suffices to achieve the optimum, which is the max-flow from the source  to each receiving nodecitations_number: 4143Citation: XORs in the Air: Practical Wireless Network Coding "Sachin Katti" "Hariharan Rahul" "Wenjun Hu" "Dina Katabi" "Muriel Medard" "Jon Crowcroft" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=75c6269579c3009b67918a10c738d89dNetwork Information Flow "Damas P.
