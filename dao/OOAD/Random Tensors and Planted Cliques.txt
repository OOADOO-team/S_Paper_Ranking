name: Random Tensors and Planted Cliquesurl: http://www.springerlink.com/content/6051533186128471public_in: International Workshop &amp; International Workshop on Approximationauthors: S. Charles Brubaker,Santosh Vempala,abstract: The r-parity tensor of a graph is a generalization of the adjacency matrix, where the tensor’s entries denote the parity of the number of edges in subgraphs induced by r distinct vertices. For r = 2, it is the adjacency matrix with 1’s for edges and - 1’s for nonedges. It is well-known that the 2-norm of the adjacency matrix of a random graph is O(sqrt{n}). Here we show that the 2-norm of the r-parity tensor is at most f(r)sqrt{n}log^{O(r)}n, answering a question of Frieze and Kannan [1] who proved this for r = 3. As a consequence, we get a tight connection between the planted clique problem and the problem of finding a vector that approximates the 2-norm of the r-parity tensor of a random graph. Our proof method is based on an inductive application of concentration of measure.citations_number: 32Citation: OPTIMAL DETECTION OF SPARSE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS IN HIGH DIMENSION "Quentin Berthet" "Philippe Rigollet" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5d53edc5ed62ef1e9d0904000a3b8c41A tensor approach to learning mixed membership community models "Animashree Anandkumar" "Rong Ge" "Daniel Hsu" "Sham M.
