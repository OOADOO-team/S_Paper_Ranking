name: Networks: Between markets and hierarchiesurl: http://www.jstor.org/stable/2485966public_in: Strategic Management Journalauthors: Hans B. Thorelli,abstract: &lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Interorganizational networks generally have been discussed in the context of nonprofit agencies. Providing an alternative between the open market and the internalization of activity the network potentially may be even more important in business. This is especially true in international operations and in industrial and services marketing. Involving technology transfer, information exchange, accounting and finance as well as marketing, network management calls for a holistic approach. To serve as an engine of growth the network also requires strategic planning both at the overall level and in member firms.&lt;/p&gt;citations_number: 2350Citation: Interorganizational Collaboration and the Locus of Innovation: Networks of Learning in Biotechnology "Walter W.
