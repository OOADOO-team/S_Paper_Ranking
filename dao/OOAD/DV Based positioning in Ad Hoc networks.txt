name: DV Based positioning in Ad Hoc networksurl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1023403323460public_in: Telecommunication Systemsauthors: Dragos Niculescu,Badri Nath,abstract: Many ad hoc network protocols and applications assume the knowledge of geographic location of nodes. The absolute position of each networked node is an assumed fact by most sensor networks which can then present the sensed information on a geographical map. Finding position without the aid of GPS in each node of an ad hoc network is important in cases where GPS is either not accessible, or not practical to use due to power, form factor or line of sight conditions. Position would also enable routing in sufficiently isotropic large networks, without the use of large routing tables. We are proposing APS – a localized, distributed, hop by hop positioning algorithm, that works as an extension of both distance vector routing and GPS positioning in order to provide approximate position for all nodes in a network where only a limited fraction of nodes have self positioning capability.citations_number: 2635Citation: 无线传感器网络中的自身定位系统和算法 "王福豹" "史龙" "任丰原" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=453a68d817621e1fb8a1af55265b08f6Practical robust localization over large-scale 802.11 wireless networks "Andreas Haeberlen" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c731a6898ceacba186090b99b5a3b7f6Secure positioning of wireless devices with application to sensor networks "Capkun, S" "Hubaux, J.-P" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7ba8ca674bce3da7bab3e4b926291238Localization with mobile anchor points in wireless sensor networks "Ssu, KuoFeng" "Ou, ChiaHo" "Jiau, Hewijin Christine" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ce90c9d2d57e6f6e57b5d22b2017c04eMonte-carlo localization for mobile wireless sensor networks "Aline Baggio, Koen Langendoen" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b6f57f56907383ac6feb0bc928de4ebeModels and solutions for radio irregularity in wireless sensor networks "Gang Zhou" "Tian He" "Sudha Krishnamurthy" "John A.
