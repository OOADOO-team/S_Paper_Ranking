name: HEED: a hybrid, energy-efficient, distributed clustering approach for ad hoc sensor networksurl: http://comjnl.oxfordjournals.org/external-ref?access_num=10.1109/TMC.2004.41&amp;link_type=DOIpublic_in: IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computingauthors: Younis, O., Fahmy, S.,abstract: Topology control in a sensor network balances load on sensor nodes  and increases network scalability and lifetime. Clustering sensor nodes  is an effective topology control approach. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed clustering approach for long-lived ad hoc sensor networks. Our proposed approach does not make any assumptions about the presence of infrastructure or about node capabilities, other than the availability of multiple power levels in sensor nodes. We present a protocol, HEED (Hybrid Energy-Efficient Distributed clustering), that periodically selects cluster heads according to a hybrid of the node residual energy and a secondary parameter, such as node proximity to its  neighbors or node degree. HEED terminates in O(1) iterations, incurs low  message overhead, and achieves fairly uniform cluster head distribution  across the network. We prove that, with appropriate bounds on node  density and intracluster and intercluster transmission ranges, HEED can  asymptotically almost surely guarantee connectivity of clustered  networks. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed approach is  effective in prolonging the network lifetime and supporting scalable  data aggregationcitations_number: 4641Citation: A survey on clustering algorithms for wireless sensor networks "Ameer Ahmed Abbasi" "Mohamed Younis" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7a1bb8ab3dbde1bab2dc56a5eb68b5afAn energy-efficient unequal clustering mechanism for wireless sensor networks "null Chengfa Li" "null Mao Ye" "null Guihai Chen" "null Jie Wu" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a68255a91d4253e7d4a1fb8a6cac0efaA Distributed Energy-Efficient Clustering Algorithm for Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks "QING Li" "ZHU Qing-Xin" "WANG Ming-Wen" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cc0ce7cb412d1712d0b4ba9268502a09An energy-efficient unequal clustering mechanism for wireless sensor networks "Chengfa Li" "Mao Ye" "Guihai Chen" "Jie Wu" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4bfadff40e324acaf04a4e143dfc99b9Data-aggregation techniques in sensor networks: A survey "Ramesh Rajagopalan" "Pramod K.
