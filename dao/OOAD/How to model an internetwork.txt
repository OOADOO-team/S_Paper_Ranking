name: How to model an internetworkurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2515500_How_to_Model_an_Internetworkpublic_in: IEEE Infocom 96 Conference on Computer Communicationsauthors: Ellen Zegura,Kenneth Calvert,Samrat Bhattacharjee,abstract: Graphs are commonly used to model the structure of internetworks, for the study of problems ranging from routing to resource reservation. A variety of graph models are found in the literature, including regular topologies such as rings or stars, &quot;well-known&quot; topologies such as the original ARPAnet, and randomly generated topologies. Less common is any discussion of how closely these models correlate with real network topologies. We consider the problem of efficiently generating graph models that accurately reflect the topological properties of real internetworks. We compare the properties of graphs generated using various methods with those of real internets. We also propose efficient methods for generating topologies with particular properties, including a transit-stub model that correlates well with the internet structure. Improved models for the internetwork structure have the potential to impact the significance of simulation studies of internetworking solutions, providing a basis for the validity of the conclusions.citations_number: 2344Citation: Scalable application layer multicast "Banerjee, Suman" "Bhattacharjee, Bobby" "Kommareddy, Christopher" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3ccbc216baab6e6efa676be5b180f66bScribe: a large-scale and decentralized application-level multicast infrastructure "Castro, Miguel" "Druschel, Peter" "Kermarrec, AnneMarie" "Rowstron, Antony I T" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3ea9e2de2f9e37c0ed40b9b7668f50a8SplitStream:high-bandwidth multicast in cooperative environments "Miguel Castro" "Peter Druschel" "Anne-Marie Kermarrec" "Animesh Nandi" "Antony Rowstron" "Atul Singh" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8dc25af42624d26fb14239e6d4621c6bTopologically-aware overlay construction and server selection "S.
