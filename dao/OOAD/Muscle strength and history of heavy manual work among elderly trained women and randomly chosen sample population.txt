name: Muscle strength and history of heavy manual work among elderly trained women and randomly chosen sample populationurl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00634301public_in: 《European Journal of Applied Physiology &amp; Occupational Physiology》authors: Taina Rantanen,Sarianna Sipilä,Harri Suominen,abstract: The association between a history of heavy work and muscle strength was studied among 51 physically active women aged 66–85 years trained in sports and 41 women aged 70–81 years selected randomly from the population register. Maximal isometric muscle strength of hand grip, arm flexion, leg extension and trunk flexion and extension were measured using specially constructed dynamometers. The capacity of the abdominal muscles was evaluated by means of a sit-up test. The study included an interview dealing with the subjects&#039; histories of heavy manual employment. The mean histories of heavy work for the trained and untrained women were 24 and 36 years, respectively. The trained women showed significantly greater maximal isometric muscle strength and abdominal muscle capacity than the untrained women. Among the trained women there was no correlation between the amount of heavy work and muscle performance. Among the untrained women the amount of heavy work correlated positively with maximal isometric trunk extension strength. The results would suggest that among elderly women, whether physically active or not, a history of heavy work has no systematic association with muscle strength.citations_number: 26Citation: Disability, physical activity, and muscle strength in older women: The women's health and aging study ☆ "Rantanen T" "Guralnik JM" "Sakari-Rantala R" "Leveille S" "Simonsick EM" "Ling S" "Fried LP" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=af8eaa23983afcb68af03a63add4e431Maximal Isometric Strength and Mobility among 75-year-old Men and Women "TAINA RANTANEN" "PERTTI ERA" "EINO HEIKKINEN" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=704cefbe6e8f1886088cf8997f068ddcAge trajectories of grip strength: cross-sectional and longitudinal data among 8,342 Danes aged 46 to 102 "Frederiksen H" "Hjelmborg J" "Mortensen J" "McGue M" "Vaupel JW" "Christensen K" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=af058f6f00a0fec7794aab37977f5b98Effects of strength and endurance training on isometric muscle strength and walking speed in elderly women "S.
