name: Investigating the energy consumption of a wireless network interface in an ad hoc networking environmenturl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/3893924_Investigating_the_energy_consumption_of_a_wireless_networkinterface_in_an_ad_hoc_networking_environmentpublic_in: Infocom Twentieth Joint Conference of the IEEE Computer &amp; Communications Societies IEEEauthors: Laura Marie Feeney,Martin Nils Peter Nilsson,abstract: Energy-aware design and evaluation of network protocols requires knowledge of the energy consumption behavior of actual wireless interfaces. But little practical information is available about the energy consumption behavior of well-known wireless network interfaces and device specifications do not provide information in a form that is helpful to protocol developers. This paper describes a series of experiments which obtained detailed measurements of the energy consumption of an IEEE 802.11 wireless network interface operating in an ad hoc networking environment. The data is presented as a collection of linear equations for calculating the energy consumed in sending, receiving and discarding broadcast and point-to-point data packets of various sizes. Some implications for protocol design and evaluation in ad hoc networks are discussedcitations_number: 2121Citation: Energy-Efficient, Collision-Free Medium Access Control for Wireless Sensor Networks "Venkatesh Rajendran" "Katia Obraczka" "J.
