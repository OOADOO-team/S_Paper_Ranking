name: A Survey of Active Network Researchurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/3195643_A_survey_of_active_network_researchpublic_in: 《IEEE Communications Magazine》authors: Tennenhouse, David L,Smith, Jonathan M,Sincoskie, W David,abstract: Active networks are a novel approach to network architecture in which the switches (or routers) of the network perform customized computations on the messages flowing through them. This approach is motivated by both lead user applications, which perform user-driven computation at nodes within the network today, and the emergence of mobile code technologies that make dynamic network service innovation attainable. The authors discuss two approaches to the realization of active networks and provide a snapshot of the current research issues and activities. They illustrate how the routers of an IP network could be augmented to perform such customized processing on the datagrams flowing through them. These active routers could also interoperate with legacy routers, which transparently forward datagrams in the traditional manner.citations_number: 2254Citation: Understanding code mobility "Picco, G.P" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2208480d977fe343d48d15699dbd263bBuilding efficient wireless sensor networks with low-level naming "John Heidemann" "Fabio Silva" "Chalermek Intanagonwiwat" "Ramesh Govindan" "Deborah Estrin" "Deepak Ganesan" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a0a8291a9ac449187361c62e2e5bc048ANTS: a toolkit for building and dynamically deploying network protocols "D.
