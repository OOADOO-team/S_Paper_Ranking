name: Random Work-Function-Induced Threshold Voltage Fluctuation in Metal-Gate MOS Devices by Monte Carlo Simulationurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/241638149_Random_Work-Function-Induced_Threshold_Voltage_Fluctuation_in_Metal-Gate_MOS_Devices_by_Monte_Carlo_Simulationpublic_in: IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturingauthors: Yiming Li,Hui-Wen Cheng,abstract: In this paper, we estimate the effect of random work function (WK) on the threshold voltage fluctuation (σVth) of 16-nm-gate metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) with metal-gate materials. To examine the random WK induced σVth, nanosized metal grains with different gate materials are considered in a large-scale statistical simulation. An analytical expression of the WK induced σVth is proposed based on the Monte Carlo simulation results which can outlook different extents of fluctuation resulting from various metal gates and benefit the device fabrication. Devices with a two-layer metal-gate are further studied for fluctuation suppression; the finding of this paper indicates the first layer of the gate structure plays the most significant role in the suppression of the WK induced σVth, compared with the second layer. This paper provides an insight into random work-function-induced threshold voltage fluctuation, which can, in turn, be used to assess metal gate characteristics of MOSFETs.citations_number: 11Citation: Statistical device simulation of intrinsic parameter fluctuation in 16-nm-gate n- and p-type Bulk FinFETs "Yu-Yu Chen" "Wen-Tsung Huang" "Sheng-Chia Hsu" "Han-Tung Chang" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=76a41b9350bce0d89588a4759ee77647Statistical device simulation of intrinsic parameter fluctuation in 16-nm-gate n- and p-type Bulk FinFETs "Yu-Yu Chen" "Wen-Tsung Huang" "Sheng-Chia Hsu" "Han-Tung Chang" "Chieh-Yang Chen" "Chin-Min Yang" "Li-Wen Chen" "Yiming Li" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f936e5d338d5364bd779173a1884e8eeEffects of the fin width variation on the performance of 16 nm FinFETs with round fin corners and tapered fin shape "S.
