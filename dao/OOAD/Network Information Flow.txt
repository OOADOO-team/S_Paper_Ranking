name: Network Information Flowurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/220682991_Network_information_flowpublic_in: IEEE Transactions on Information Theoryauthors: Rudolf Ahlswede,Ning Cai,Shuo-Yen Robert Li,abstract: We introduce a new class of problems called network information flow which is inspired by computer network applications. Consider a point-to-point communication network on which a number of information sources are to be multicast to certain sets of destinations. We assume that the information sources are mutually independent. The problem is to characterize the admissible coding rate region. This model subsumes all previously studied models along the same line. We study the problem with one information source, and we have obtained a simple characterization of the admissible coding rate region. Our result can be regarded as the max-flow min-cut theorem for network information flow. Contrary to one&#039;s intuition, our work reveals that it is in general not optimal to regard the information to be multicast as a &quot;fluid&quot; which can simply be routed or replicated. Rather, by employing coding at the nodes, which we refer to as network coding, bandwidth can in general be saved. This finding may have significant impact on future design of switching systems.citations_number: 9549Citation: Linear network coding "Li, ShuoYen Robert" "Yeung, Raymond W" "Cai, Ning" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f6d3071307eef6cb952e9890a18d07bdXORs in the Air: Practical Wireless Network Coding "Sachin Katti" "Hariharan Rahul" "Wenjun Hu" "Dina Katabi" "Muriel Medard" "Jon Crowcroft" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=75c6269579c3009b67918a10c738d89dAn algebraic approach to network coding "Koetter, Ralf" "Médard, Muriel" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3ea8d912f969128e36ae41e4093c1f99Beyond routing: an algebraic approach to network coding "R.
