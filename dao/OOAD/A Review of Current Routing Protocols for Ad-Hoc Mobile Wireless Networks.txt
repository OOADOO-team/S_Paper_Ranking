name: A Review of Current Routing Protocols for Ad-Hoc Mobile Wireless Networksurl: http://logcom.oxfordjournals.org/external-ref?access_num=10.1109/98.760423&amp;link_type=DOIpublic_in: IEEE Personal Communicationsauthors: Elizabeth M. Royer,Chai-Keong Toh,abstract: An ad hoc mobile network is a collection of mobile nodes that are dynamically and arbitrarily located in such a manner that the interconnections between nodes are capable of changing on a continual basis. In order to facilitate communication within the network, a routing protocol is used to discover routes between nodes. The primary goal of such an ad hoc network routing protocol is correct and efficient route establishment between a pair of nodes so that messages may be delivered in a timely manner. Route construction should be done with a minimum of overhead and bandwidth consumption. This article examines routing protocols for ad hoc networks and evaluates these protocols based on a given set of parameters. The article provides an overview of eight different protocols by presenting their characteristics and functionality, and then provides a comparison and discussion of their respective merits and drawbacks.citations_number: 5161Citation: Probabilistic Routing in Intermittently Connected Networks "Anders Lindgren" "Avri Doria" "Olov Schel√©n" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e0877a942218ce20148f48453827bc79Energy aware routing for low energy ad hoc sensor networks "R.C.
