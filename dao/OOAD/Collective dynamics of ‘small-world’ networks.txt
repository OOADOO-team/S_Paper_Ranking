name: Collective dynamics of ‘small-world’ networksurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM9623998public_in: Natureauthors: Duncan J. Watts,Steven H. Strogatz,abstract: Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators, Josephson junction arrays, excitable media, neural networks, spatial games, genetic control networks and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks &#039;rewired&#039; to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them &#039;small-world&#039; networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon (popularly known as six degrees of separation. The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.citations_number: 3Citation: Emergence of scaling in random networks "Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo" "Albert, Reka" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dd5a2f507c7266034fb152fcc6acefe52002): “Statistical mechanics of complex networks "Réka Albert" "Albert-László Barabási" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=97250f86fca0e2aa57af0c72c1f99bb4Statistical mechanics of complex networks "Réka Albert" "AlbertLászló Barabási" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=09de58bced0f9e3d9cc6a9e1cf2dce65Finding and evaluating community structure in networks.
