name: Random Access With Physical-Layer Network Codingurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/233981887_Random_Access_With_Physical-Layer_Network_Coding?ev=auth_pubpublic_in: Information Theory &amp; Applications Workshopauthors: Jasper Goseling,Michael Gastpar,Jos H. Weber,abstract: Leveraging recent progress in compute-and-forward we propose an approach to random access that is based on physical-layer network coding: When packets collide, it is possible to recover a linear combination of the packets at the receiver. Over many rounds of transmission, the receiver can thus obtain many linear combinations and eventually recover all original packets. This is by contrast to slotted ALOHA where packet collisions lead to complete erasures. The throughput of the proposed strategy is derived for a system with two users and shown to be significantly superior to the best known strategies, including multipacket reception.citations_number: 26Citation: Physical-layer network coding on the random-access channel "Goseling, J" "Gastpar, M" "Weber, J.H" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a489a5f9820d41d408fa0c3d0264b481Multiuser Rate-Diverse Network-Coded Multiple Access "Haoyuan Pan" "Lu Lu" "Soung Chang Liew" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=acb0b92645a3034c4592f4f18e0274d1Sign-Compute-Resolve for Random Access "Jasper Goseling" "Cedomir Stefanovic" "Petar Popovski" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=94f8c893adeb2fc8cc67a7a4d8773f61Seek and decode: Random access with physical‐layer network coding and multiuser detection "Cocco, Giuseppe" "Pfletschinger, Stephan" "Navarro, Monica" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d97de3b6d8cc7d2d6554cf4b6d5a74b1Network-Coded Multiple Access with High-order Modulations "Haoyuan PAN" "Lu Lu" "Soung-Chang Liew" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4f0acfad9728528394b71e8ccb3a39f6Sign-compute-resolve for random access "Jasper Goseling" "Cedomir Stefanović" "Petar Popovski" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=feac53f4df1adf440545f4ce26d4193bNetwork-Coded Multiple Access with Higher-Order Modulations "Haoyuan Pan" "Lu Lu" "Soung Chang Liew" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ef9f0c041dfb9b249cfb6ced1701e974Protocol Sequences for the Multiple-Packet Reception Channel Without Feedback "Yijin Zhang" "Yuan-Hsun Lo" "Wing Shing Wong" "Feng Shu" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=60cf1d01b8ca7c94e4bf19f394fd04dePractical Power-Balanced Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access "Haoyuan Pan" "Lu Lu" "Soung Chang Liew" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9077c27844e4e9dd4bb917a4571854bcA pseudo-Bayesian approach to sign-compute-resolve slotted ALOHA "Jasper Goseling" "Čedomir Stefanović" "Petar Popovski" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ed367ac49c9f396c7ee580b20682a27cReferences: Hot topic:physical-layer network coding "Shengli Zhang" "Soung Chang Liew" "Patrick P.
