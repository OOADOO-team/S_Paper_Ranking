name: Versatile low power media access for wireless sensor networksurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221091500_Versatile_low_power_media_access_for_wireless_sensor_networkspublic_in: International Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systemsauthors: Joseph Polastre,Jason Hill,David Culler,abstract: &lt;p&gt;We propose &amp;#60;i&gt;B-MAC&amp;#60;/i&gt;, a carrier sense media access protocol for wireless sensor networks that provides a flexible interface to obtain ultra low power operation, effective collision avoidance, and high channel utilization. To achieve low power operation, &amp;#60;i&gt;B-MAC&amp;#60;/i&gt; employs an adaptive preamble sampling scheme to reduce duty cycle and minimize idle listening. &amp;#60;i&gt;B-MAC&amp;#60;/i&gt; supports on-the-fly reconfiguration and provides bidirectional interfaces for system services to optimize performance, whether it be for throughput, latency, or power conservation. We build an analytical model of a class of sensor network applications. We use the model to show the effect of changing &amp;#60;i&gt;B-MAC&amp;#60;/i&gt;&#039;s parameters and predict the behavior of sensor network applications. By comparing &amp;#60;i&gt;B-MAC&amp;#60;/i&gt; to conventional 802.11-inspired protocols, specifically SMAC, we develop an experimental characterization of &amp;#60;i&gt;B-MAC&amp;#60;/i&gt; over a wide range of network conditions. We show that &amp;#60;i&gt;B-MAC&amp;#60;/i&gt;&#039;s flexibility results in better packet delivery rates, throughput, latency, and energy consumption than S-MAC. By deploying a real world monitoring application with multihop networking, we validate our protocol design and model. Our results illustrate the need for flexible protocols to effectively realize energy efficient sensor network applications.&lt;/p&gt;citations_number: 3799Citation: Wireless sensor network survey "Yick, Jennifer" "Mukherjee, Biswanath" "Ghosal, Dipak" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7c879c20605074d6280749301bd8924bVersatile low power media access for wireless sensor networks "Joseph Polastre" "Jason Hill" "David Culler" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5d9d47aa02ceeb84e2a393aaa9d8c0d0无线传感器网络研究进展 "" "" "" "" "" "" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a581e45b0a188ad6e9b80b32a87a8349An Energy-Efficient MAC Protocol for Wireless Sensor Network "Bao-Mao Pang" "Hao-Shan Shi" "Yan-Xiao Li" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7fc8e660742a1007b847bcfd0542bccdEnergy conservation in wireless sensor networks: A survey "Giuseppe Anastasi" "Marco Conti" "Mario Di Francesco" "Andrea Passarella" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6f2b82a43be089edc1f76e1b37e95e51X-MAC:a short preamble MAC protocol for duty-cycled wireless sensor networks "Michael Buettner" "Gary V.
