name: Network Dyads in Entrepreneurial Settings: A Study of the Governance of Exchange Relationshipsurl: http://www.jstor.org/stable/2393534public_in: Administrative Science Quarterlyauthors: Andrea Larson,abstract: Social control in network organizational forms is examined through an inductive field study of a sample of dyadic relationships established by high-growth entrepreneurial firms.  The social dimensions of the transactions are central in explaining control and coordination in the exchange structures.  A process model of network formation is presented that highlights the importance of reputation, trust, reciprocity, and mutual interdependence.  The network form is proposed as an alternative to vertical integration for high-growth entrepreneurial firms.  The data also suggest that studying the network form of governance can provide insights into firm growth.citations_number: 2693Citation: Social Capital, Intellectual Capital, and the Organizational Advantage "Janine Nahapiet" "Sumantra Ghoshal" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=02dda015851d618407c0f109b279fe3eThe Relational View: Cooperative Strategy and Sources of Interorganizational Competitive Advantage "Jeffrey H.
