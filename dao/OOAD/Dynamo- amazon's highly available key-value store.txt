name: Dynamo: amazon's highly available key-value storeurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/220910159_Dynamo_amazon's_highly_available_key-value_storepublic_in: ACM SIGOPS Operating Systems Reviewauthors: DeCandia, Giuseppe,Hastorun, Deniz,Jampani, Madan,abstract: Reliability at massive scale is one of the biggest challenges we face at Amazon.com, one of the largest e-commerce operations in the world; even the slightest outage has significant financial consequences and impacts customer trust. The Amazon.com platform, which provides services for many web sites worldwide, is implemented on top of an infrastructure of tens of thousands of servers and network components located in many datacenters around the world. At this scale, small and large components fail continuously and the way persistent state is managed in the face of these failures drives the reliability and scalability of the software systems. This paper presents the design and implementation of Dynamo, a highly available key-value storage system that some of Amazon&#039;s core services use to provide an &quot;always-on&quot; experience. To achieve this level of availability, Dynamo sacrifices consistency under certain failure scenarios. It makes extensive use of object versioning and application-assisted conflict resolution in a manner that provides a novel interface for developers to use.citations_number: 3612Citation: The Eucalyptus Open-Source Cloud-Computing System "Daniel Nurmi" "Rich Wolski" "Chris Grzegorczyk" "Graziano Obertelli" "Sunil Soman" "Lamia Youseff" "Dmitrii Zagorodnov" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cfb58a00316880f15680daf9cbd2c564Pig latin:a not-so-foreign language for data processing "Christopher Olston" "Benjamin Reed" "Utkarsh Srivastava" "Ravi Kumar" "Andrew Tomkins" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=39cc099a456ce472ae03cc7a54050182A scalable, commodity data center network architecture "Mohammad Al-Fares" "Alexander Loukissas" "Amin Vahdat" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d55a0ba072a1727768b9645d402422a5云计算:系统实例与研究现状 "陈康" "郑纬民" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7e8bb75f47e1484cebbe4677e3418f4fCassandra:a decentralized structured storage system "Avinash Lakshman" "Prashant Malik" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=942a31c39401841fa2c672735576deab大数据管理:概念、技术与挑战 "孟小峰" "慈祥" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9a07b1cb7ad042809e2dcc6c6d4f5dccThe Datacenter as a Computer:An Introduction to the Design of Warehouse-Scale Machines "Luis Andre Barroso" "Jimmy Clidaras" "Urs Hoelzle" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f52861dfd2b5b67608fe2abdf35b315dBenchmarking cloud serving systems with YCSB "Brian F.
