name: Random Early Markingurl: http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-39939-9_4public_in: International Workshop on Quality of Future Internet Servicesauthors: Sanjeewa Athuraliya,David Lapsley,abstract: Random Early Marking (REM) consists of a link algorithm, that probabilistically marks packets inside the network, and a source algorithm, that adapts source rate to observed marking.The marking probability is exponential in a link congestion measure, so that the end- to-end marking probability is exponential in a path congestion measure. Marking allows a source to estimate its path congestion measure and adjusts its rate in a way that aligns individual optimality with social optimality.We describe the REM algorithm, summarize its key properties, and present some simulation results that demonstrate its stability, fairness and robustness.citations_number: 67Citation: Internet research needs better models "Sally Floyd" "Eddie Kohler" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ac8af2519ecefc625ace7f085d0b2215Models for a self-managed Internet "Kelly, Frank P" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=425e91ac1050b1883ef72a5b00f3ffdbOptimization based rate control for multirate multicast sessions "Kar, K" "Sarkar, S" "Tassiulas, L" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=41012723e49b3b93112c7e197416c243A simple rate control algorithm for max total user utility "by K Kar" "S Sarkar" "L Tassiulas" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e6e67398f68d0f01ad3ae02048975aefAn enhanced random early marking algorithm for Internet flow control "Athuraliya, Sanjeewa" "Lapsley, D" "Low, S" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9b038c4552ba1caed1138465b56d1f07A scalable, low-overhead rate control algorithm for multirate multicast sessions "KAR" "Koushik" "SARKAR" "Saswati" "TASSIULAS" "Leandros" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6e7b57d306c9d33b724250b6ab95aef0Optimization flow control with Newton‚Äêlike algorithm "Sanjeewa Athuraliya" "Steven H.
