name: On-line fountain codes for semi-random loss channelsurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/239761961_On-line_fountain_codes_for_semi-random_loss_channelspublic_in: Information Theory Workshopauthors: Cassuto, Y,Shokrollahi, A,abstract: A fountain coding framework is proposed that endows receivers with the ability to monitor and control the decoding progress given the instantaneous network conditions. These online features allow an optimal recovery from losses manifested by adversarial or other not purely random processes. A uni-partite graph structure and accompanying algorithms are used to efficiently calculate optimal instantaneous degrees. Using analysis of random-graph processes, the average overhead of a simplified scheme is shown to be upper bounded by 0.236, significantly lower than any known on-line fountain scheme.citations_number: 10Citation: Near real-time rateless coding with a constrained feedback budget "Hashemi, M" "Trachtenberg, A" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c769d99322899e757b85886a03486a3dOnline Fountain Codes With Low Overhead "Yuval Cassuto" "Amin Shokrollahi" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1dc38271d33529a6862c187b37555b91Delete-and-Conquer: Rateless coding with constrained feedback "Morteza Hashemi" "Ari Trachtenberg" "Yuval Cassuto" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8712ac9cdea7c0fd19419883237221d8CDP:a coded datagram transport protocol bridging UDP and TCP "Morteza Hashemi" "Ari Trachtenberg" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2d905c43d23d78e6226a03ee620b2549CDP: a coded datagram transport protocol bridging UDP and TCP "Morteza Hashemi" "Ari Trachtenberg" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=88865cb8a297048378fe7803826c9b5cFountain Codes With Nonuniform Selection Distributions Through Feedback "Morteza Hashemi" "Yuval Cassuto" "Ari Trachtenberg" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4573b66c0ca8a1968a1da67d964d8152Distributed computing column 49:coding for distributed storage "Idit Keidar" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2f4d86c6a13246873e5c55ebc9c4152aStaged Growth Codes: Intermediate Performance and Overhead Analysis.
