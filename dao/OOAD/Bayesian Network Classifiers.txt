name: Bayesian Network Classifiersurl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1007465528199public_in: Machine Learningauthors: Nir Friedman, Dan Geiger, Moises Goldszmidt,abstract: Recent work in supervised learning has shown that a surprisingly  simple Bayesian classifier with strong assumptions of independence among  features, called naive Bayes, is competitive with state-of-the-art  classifiers such as C4.5. This fact raises the question of whether a  classifier with less restrictive assumptions can perform even better. In  this paper we evaluate approaches for inducing classifiers from data,  based on the theory of learning Bayesian networks. These networks are  factor representations of probability distributions that generalize the  naive Bayesian classifier and explicitly represent statements about  independence. Among these approaches we single out a method we call tree  augmented naive (TAN) Bayes, which outperforms naive Bayes, yet at the  same time maintains the computational simplicity (no search involved)  and robustness that characterize naive Bayes. We experimentally tested  these approaches, using problems from the University of California at  Irvine repository, and compared them to C4.5, naive Bayes, and wrapper  methods for feature selectioncitations_number: 4656Citation: Data Mining: Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques (Third Edition) "Ian H.
