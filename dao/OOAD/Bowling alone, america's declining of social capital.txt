Bowling Alone: America&#039;s Declining Social Capital  Robert D. Putnam  An Interview with Robert Putnam  Many students of the new democracies that have emerged over the past decade and a half have emphasized the importance of a strong and active civil society to the consolidation of democracy. Especially with regard to the postcommunist countries, scholars and democratic activists alike have lamented the absence or obliteration of traditions of independent civic engagement and a widespread tendency toward passive reliance on the state. To those concerned with the weakness of civil societies in the developing or postcommunist world, the advanced Western democracies and above all the United States have typically been taken as models to be emulated. There is striking evidence, however, that the vibrancy of American civil society has notably declined over the past several decades.  Ever since the publication of Alexis de Tocqueville&#039;s Democracy in America , the United States has played a central role in systematic studies of the links between democracy and civil society. Although this is in part because trends in American life are often regarded as harbingers of social modernization, it is also because America has traditionally been considered unusually &quot;civic&quot; (a reputation that, as we shall later see, has not been entirely unjustified).  When Tocqueville visited the United States in the 1830s, it was the Americans&#039; propensity for civic association that most impressed him as the key to their unprecedented ability to make democracy work. &quot;Americans of all ages, all stations in life, and all types of disposition,&quot; he observed, &quot;are forever forming associations. There are not only commercial and industrial associations in which all take part, but others of a thousand different types -- religious, moral, serious, futile, very general and very limited, immensely large and very minute. . . . Nothing, in my view, deserves more attention than the intellectual and moral associations in America.&quot;  Recently, American social scientists of a neo-Tocquevillean bent have unearthed a wide range of empirical evidence that the quality of public life and the performance of social institutions (and not only in America) are indeed powerfully influenced by norms and networks of civic engagement. Researchers in such fields as education, urban poverty, unemployment, the control of crime and drug abuse, and even health have discovered that successful outcomes are more likely in civically engaged communities. Similarly, research on the varying economic attainments of different ethnic groups in the United States has demonstrated the importance of social bonds within each group. These results are consistent with research in a wide range of settings that demonstrates the vital importance of social networks for job placement and many other economic outcomes.  Meanwhile, a seemingly unrelated body of research on the sociology of economic development has also focused attention on the role of social networks. Some of this work is situated in the developing countries, and some of it elucidates the peculiarly successful &quot;network capitalism&quot; of East Asia. Even in less exotic Western economies, however, researchers have discovered highly efficient, highly flexible &quot;industrial districts&quot; based on networks of collaboration among workers and small entrepreneurs. Far from being paleoindustrial anachronisms, these dense interpersonal and interorganizational networks undergird ultramodern industries, from the high tech of Silicon Valley to the high fashion of Benetton.  The norms and networks of civic engagement also powerfully affect the perfocitations_number: 4651Citation: Social Capital, Intellectual Capital, and the Organizational Advantage "Janine Nahapiet" "Sumantra Ghoshal" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=02dda015851d618407c0f109b279fe3eSocial capital: Its origins and applications in modern sociology.
