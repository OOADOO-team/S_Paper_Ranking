name: Fast True Random Generator in FPGAsurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/4328548_Fast_True_Random_Generator_in_FPGAspublic_in: IEEE Northeast Workshop on Circuits &amp; Systemsauthors: J.L. Danger,S. Guilley,P. Hoogvorst,abstract: Most hardware &quot;true&quot; random number generators (TRNGs) take advantage of the thermal agitation around a flip-flop metastable state. In field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), the classical TRNG structure uses two clocks, either from a PLL or from ring oscillators, in order to sample one by the other. This creates good TRNGs albeit limited in frequency by the interference rate which cannot exceed a few Mbit/s. This article presents an architecture allowing higher bit rates while maintaining provable unconditional security. This requirement becomes stringent for secure communication applications such as the cryptographic quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. The proposed architecture is very simple as it is based on an open loop structure without any specific component such as PLLs.citations_number: 21Citation: High speed true random number generator based on open loop structures in FPGAs "Danger, J. -L" "Guilley, S" "Hoogvorst, P" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=94e66546f5f6db20a659739e2212d04cTrue-Randomness and Pseudo-Randomness in Ring Oscillator-Based True Random Number Generators "However" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=76c5fe98f9443305b5090107575be7a2Dual-Metastability Time-Competitive True Random Number Generator.
