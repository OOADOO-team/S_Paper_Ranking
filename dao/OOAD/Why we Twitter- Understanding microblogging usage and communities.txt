Twitter, a popular microblogging tool has seen a lot  of growth since it launched in October, 2006. In this paper,  we present our observations of the microblogging phenomena  by studying the topological and geographical properties  of Twitterâ€™s social network. We find that people use microblogging  to talk about their daily activities and to seek  or share information. Finally, we analyze the user intentions  associated at a community level and show how users with  similar intentions connect with each other.citations_number: 2536Citation: TwitterRank:finding topic-sensitive influential twitterers "Jianshu Weng" "Ee-Peng Lim" "Jing Jiang" "Qi He" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5ef0eb1dbf66e45324d514038d96a67eTweet, Tweet, Retweet: Conversational Aspects of Retweeting on Twitter "Danah Boyd" "Scott Golder" "Gilad Lotan" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=290897a3e414b9e3235f0bae19f85929A few chirps about twitter "Balachander Krishnamurthy" "Phillipa Gill" "Martin Arlitt" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=408636054111c1541179a975f7630c43Information credibility on twitter "Castillo" "Carlos" "Marcelo" "Poblete" "Barbara" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=96db8d47904860a2e681713c1df31754Want to be Retweeted?
