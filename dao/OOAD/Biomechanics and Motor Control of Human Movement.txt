name: Biomechanics and Motor Control of Human Movementurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/238687045_Biomechanics_and_motor_control_of_human_movementpublic_in: Noneauthors: D. A. Winter,abstract: The following topics are considered in this book: gait analysis - considerations and terminology; temporal and stride measures; kinematics; kinetics; electromyography in human gait; balance and posture in human gait; degenerative gait in the elderly; assessment of pathological gait; and tables of selected curves. This book is intended to be a resource of normative data for both young adults and the fit and healthy elderly, and how to interpret and integrate those variables, especially as they relate to motor control of the skeletal system. It is aimed at rehabilitation personnel in a range of medical disciplines, researchers in basic human movement, and physical education researchers and teachers.citations_number: 6219Citation: Humans integrate visual and haptic information in a statistically optimal fashion.
