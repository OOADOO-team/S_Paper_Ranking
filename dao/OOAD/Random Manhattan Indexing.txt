Zadeh,Siegfried Handschuh,abstract: Vector space models (VSMs) are mathematically well-defined frameworks that have been widely used in text processing. In these models, high-dimensional, often sparse vectors represent text units. In an application, the similarity of vectors and hence the text units that they represent is computed by a distance formula. The high dimensionality of vectors, however, is a barrier to the performance of methods that employ VSMs. Consequently, a dimensionality reduction technique is employed to alleviate this problem. This paper introduces a new method, called Random Manhattan Indexing (RMI), for the construction of L1 normed VSMs at reduced dimensionality. RMI combines the construction of a VSM anddimension reduction into an incremental, and thus scalable, procedure. In order to attain its goal, RMI employs the sparse Cauchy random projections.citations_number: 8Citation: Random Indexing Revisited "Behrang QasemiZadeh" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=11b6e71836bc2d429119897b1b7b65d3Random Indexing Revisited "Behrang QasemiZadeh" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8277e176230544f220c3e1de01f5c8f5Random Indexing Explained with High Probability "Behrang QasemiZadeh" "Siegfried Handschuh" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9f3d9700fffd9503d21c9ee17a16d0dcRandom Manhattan Indexing A Randomized Scalable Method for Semantic Similarity Measurement in L1 Normed Spaces "Behrang Qasemi Zadeh" "Siegfried Handschuh" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=df6bf82ce8461b3e9e2dc5e56b4c48f3Random Indexing Explained with High Probability "QasemiZadeh" "Behrang" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a6e2ddf04a7874546f433555737ba98cRandom Indexing Explained with High Probability "Behrang Qasemizadeh" "Siegfried Handschuh" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5bba43450eb418361bf7fb84ecbad041References: From Frequency to Meaning: Vector Space Models of Semantics "Turney, P.
