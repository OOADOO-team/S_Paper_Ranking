name: Centrality in Social Networks' Conceptual Clarificationurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378873378900217public_in: Social Networksauthors: Linton C. Freeman,abstract: The intuitive background for measures of structural centrality in social networks is reviewed and existing measures are evaluated in terms of their consistency with intuitions and their interpretability. Three distinct intuitive conceptions of centrality are uncovered and existing measures are refined to embody these conceptions. Three measures are developed for each concept, one absolute and one relative measure of the centrality of positions in a network, and one reflecting the degree of centralization of the entire network. The implications of these measures for the experimental study of small groups is examined.citations_number: 8978Citation: Interorganizational Collaboration and the Locus of Innovation: Networks of Learning in Biotechnology "Walter W.
