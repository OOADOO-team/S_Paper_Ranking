Calandrino,J. Alex Halderman,Edward W. Felten,abstract: ABSTRACT  Generation of random numbers is a critical compo- nent of existing post-election auditing techniques. Recent work has largely discouraged the use of all pseudorandom number generators, including cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs), for this purpose, instead recommending the sole use of observ- able physical techniques. In particular, simple dice rolling has received a great deal of positive attention (4, 6, 9). The typical justification for this recommendation is that those less comfortable with mathematics prefer a simple, observable technique. This paper takes a contrary view. Simple, observable techniques like dice rolling are not necessarily robust against sleight of hand and other forms of fraud, and attempts to harden them against fraud can dramatically increase their complexity. With simple dice rolling, we know of no techniques that provide citizens with a reasonable means of verifying that fraud did not occur during the roll process. CSPRNGs, used properly, can be simple, robust, and verifiable, and they allow for the use of auditing techniques that might otherwise be im- practical. While we understand initial skepticism towards this option, we argue that appropriate use of CSPRNGs would strengthen audit security.citations_number: 9Citation: On the use of financial data as a random beacon "Jeremy Clark" "Urs Hengartner" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=078951b8989c5d7e86340788fe8759f4Single-ballot risk-limiting audits using convex optimization "Stephen Checkoway" "Anand Sarwate" "Hovav Shacham" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8c195dc46df1fe59569da2ec08badaf8Single-Ballot Risk-Limiting Audits Using Convex Optimization "Stephen Checkoway" "Anand Sarwate" "Hovav Shacham" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c468de65d7cc2af4f455a6f9591a136dOpenScan: a fully transparent optical scan voting system "Eric Rescorla" "Eric Rescorla" "Hovav Shacham" "Serge Belongie" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f792583b19a704d9864503741f3159f6On the security of election audits with low entropy randomness "Rescorla, Eric" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8ac4bcc568ced4df8fc2bfea5363096cComputational complexity and information asymmetry in election audits with low-entropy randomness "Nadia Heninger" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4473407cf05dfca7d1fb0797a3d19a05References: Analysis of an Electronic Voting System "Tadayoshi Kohno" "Adam Stubblefield" "Aviel D.
