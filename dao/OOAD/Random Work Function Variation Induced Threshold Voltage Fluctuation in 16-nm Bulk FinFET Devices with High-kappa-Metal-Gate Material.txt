name: Random Work Function Variation Induced Threshold Voltage Fluctuation in 16-nm Bulk FinFET Devices with High-kappa-Metal-Gate Materialurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/251982006_Random_work_function_variation_induced_threshold_voltage_fluctuation_in_16-nm_bulk_FinFET_devices_with_high-k-metal-gate_materialpublic_in: International Workshop on Computational Electronicsauthors: Cheng, HuiWen,Li, Yiming,abstract: Random work-function (WK) induced threshold voltage fluctuation (σVth) in 16-nm TiN metal-gate fin-type field effect transistors (FinFETs) is explored and modeled by using an experimentally validated Monte Carlo simulation approach. The influences of metal-grain size and device geometry aspect ratio on the random WK-induced σVth are studied analytically. The results of this study allow us to identify suitable materials for metal gate and to clarify reduction of the σVth owing to WKF. Among four different gate materials, the titanium nitride possesses the smallest σVth due to small size of metal grains.citations_number: 4Citation: Study of High-k\/Metal-Gate Work-Function Variation Using Rayleigh Distribution "Hyohyun Nam" "Changhwan Shin" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bd0ac1e5e55023c85a57f62ec6c052a9Random Work-Function-Induced Threshold Voltage Fluctuation in Metal-Gate MOS Devices by Monte Carlo Simulation "Yiming Li" "Hui-Wen Cheng" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dcfb4dbff2f4ae4ad41a17e7ddb00083高k栅介质MOS器件的特性模拟与实验研究 "" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=50635b55f445127ffdb74558b28fad66Oxidation Mechanism of Si1-xGex Nanowires with Au Catalyst Tip as a Function of Ge Content "Bae JM" "Jeong KS" "Lee WJ" "Baik M" "Park J" "Cho MH" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=add68af26180ead059ac259347a993b8References: Modeling and analysis of grain-orientation effects in emerging metal-gate devices and implications for SRAM reliability "Dadgour, H" "Endo, K" "De, V" "Banerjee, K" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=17e8ce05d5bfb3ddb08b6765741435ffComprehensive analysis of variability sources of FinFET characteristics "Matsukawa, T" "O'uchi, S" "Endo, K" "Ishikawa, Y" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=468da6ff9840c909755558aed9cd6f70Impact of additional factors in threshold voltage variability of metal\/high-k gate stacks and its reduction by controlling crystalline structure and grain ...
