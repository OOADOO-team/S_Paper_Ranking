name: Deterministic Random Walksurl: http://www.scilit.net/article/10.1137/1.9781611972962.1public_in: 《Proceedings of the Workshop on Analytic Algorithmics &amp; Combinatorics》authors: Joshua, Coopert,Benjamin, Doerr,Joel, Spencer,abstract: Jim Propp’s P-machine, also known as ‘rotor router model’ is a simple deterministic process that simulates random walk on a graph. Instead of distributing chipsto randomly chosen neighbors, it serves the neighbors in a fixed order.We investigate how well this process simulates a random walk. For the graph being the infinite path, we show that, independent of the starting configuration, at each time and on each vertex, the number of chips on this vertex deviates from the expected number of chips in the random walk model by at most a constant c1, which is approximately 2.29. For intervals of length L, this improves to a difference of O(log L) (instead of 2.29L), for the L2 average of a contiguous set of intervals even to O(√log L). It seems plausible that similar results hold for higher-dimensional grids Zd instead of the path Z.citations_number: 13Citation: Deterministic Random Walks on the Two-Dimensional Grid "Doerr, Benjamin" "Friedrich, Tobias" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e7c822286c665c6fe37e8e97920d3643Deterministic Random Walks on the Two-Dimensional Grid "Benjamin Doerr" "Tobias Friedrich" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8f39295d084bd9ffa2f4d1635782a419Deterministic Random Walks on the Two-Dimensional Grid "DOERR BENJAMIN" "FRIEDRICH TOBIAS" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=edf9d590d06f1b706e7ae036c595106aRotor Walks and Markov Chains "Holroyd, Alexander E" "Propp, James" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=feb57831c963e2d39544a34032ac788aRotor Walks on General Trees "Angel, Omer" "Holroyd, Alexander E" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=442f389459e30bb6535478e4302d8131Recurrent Rotor-Router Configurations "Angel" "Omer" "Holroyd" "Alexander E" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cdd71f6090bc58c74eed877a59c1bb68Rotor walks on general trees "Omer Angel" "Alexander E.
