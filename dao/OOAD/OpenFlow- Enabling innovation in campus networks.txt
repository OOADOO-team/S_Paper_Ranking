name: OpenFlow: Enabling innovation in campus networksurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/220195143_OpenFlow_enabling_innovation_in_campus_networkspublic_in: ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Reviewauthors: Nick McKeown,Tom Anderson,Hari Balakrishnan,abstract: This research article focuses on application of open flow protocol which is a very useful milestone for researchers to run experimental protocols in their daily used network. Open flow protocol is based on the traditional Ethernet switch, with an internal flow table and a standardized interface for the perspective of adding and removing flow entries. The primary focus of our research is to...
