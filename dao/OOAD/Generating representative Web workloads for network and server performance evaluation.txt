name: Generating representative Web workloads for network and server performance evaluationurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2948543_Generating_Representative_Web_Workloads_for_Network_and_Server_Performance_Evaluationpublic_in: Acm Sigmetrics International Conference on Meas Urement &amp; Modeling of Computer Systemsauthors: Barford, Paul,Crovella, Mark,abstract: ABSTRACT  One role for workload generation is as a means for understanding how servers and networks respond to variation in load. This enables management and capacity planning based on current and projected usage. This paper applies a number of observations of Web server usage to create a realistic Web workload generation tool which mimics a set of real users accessing a server. The tool, called Surge (Scalable URL Reference Generator) generates references matching empirical measurements of 1) server file size distribution# 2) request size distribution# 3) relative file popularity# 4) embedded file references# 5) temporal locality of reference# and 6) idle periods of individual users. This paper reviews the essential elements required in the generation of a representative Web workload. It also addresses the technical challenges to satisfying this large set of simultaneous constraints on the properties of the reference stream, the solutions we adopted, and their associated accuracy. Finally, we present evidence that Surge exercises servers in a manner significantly different from other Web server benchmarks.citations_number: 1924Citation: Analyzing peer-to-peer traffic across large networks "Sen, Subhabrata" "Wang, Jia" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e0e42c6a56feb2853cb8f4dbc8f43eecMeasurement, modeling and analyis of a peer-to-peer file-sharing workload "Gummadi, Krishna P" "Dunn, Richard J" "Saroiu, Stefan" "Gribble, Steven D" "Levy, Henry M" "Zahorjan, John" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4a72bd52f9b1acc2b9d038cb362e7944Dynamic load balancing on Web-server systems "Cardellini, V" "Colajanni, M" "Yu, P.S" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c3a9aa9f1b5f99ff6aa8508ddeb5773eFlash crowds and denial of service attacks:characterization and implications for CDNs and web sites "Jaeyeon Jung" "Balachander Krishnamurthy" "Michael Rabinovich" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4df1126550055dc89e7f882fa71e3ffbDynamics of IP traffic:a study of the role of variability and the impact of control "Anja Feldmann" "Anna C.
