name: Random early detection gateways for congestion avoidanceurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/3334193_Random_early_detection_gateways_for_congestion_avoidancepublic_in: IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networkingauthors: Floyd, S., Jacobson, V.,abstract: The authors present random early detection (RED) gateways for  congestion avoidance in packet-switched networks. The gateway detects incipient congestion by computing the average queue size. The gateway could notify connections of congestion either by dropping packets arriving at the gateway or by setting a bit in packet headers. When the average queue size exceeds a present threshold, the gateway drops or marks each arriving packet with a certain probability, where the exact probability is a function of the average queue size. RED gateways keep the average queue size low while allowing occasional bursts of packets in the queue. During congestion, the probability that the gateway notifies a particular connection to reduce its window is roughly proportional to that connection&#039;s share of the bandwidth through the gateway. RED gateways are designed to accompany a transport-layer congestion control protocol such as TCP. The RED gateway has no bias against bursty traffic and avoids the global synchronization of many connections decreasing their window at the same time. Simulations of a TCP/IP network are used to illustrate the performance of RED gatewayscitations_number: 9077Citation: Promoting the Use of End-to-End Congestion Control in the Internet "Floyd, Sally" "Fall, K" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=64f042c1851f674640afa8d0e7a6e38bOptimization flow control.
