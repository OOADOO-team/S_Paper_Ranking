name: Medium Access Control With Coordinated Adaptive Sleeping for Wireless Sensor Networksurl: http://www.emeraldinsight.com/servlet/linkout?suffix=b6&amp;dbid=16&amp;doi=10.1108%2F17427370810890382&amp;key=10.1109%2FTNET.2004.828953public_in: 《Journal of Electronic Measurement &amp; Instrument》authors: W., Ye,J., Heidemann,D., Estrin,abstract: This paper proposes S-MAC, a medium access control (MAC) protocol designed for wireless sensor networks. Wireless sensor networks use battery-operated computing and sensing devices. A network of these devices will collaborate for a common application such as environmental monitoring. We expect sensor networks to be deployed in an ad hoc fashion, with nodes remaining largely inactive for long time, but becoming suddenly active when something is detected. These characteristics of sensor networks and applications motivate a MAC that is different from traditional wireless MACs such as IEEE 802.11 in several ways: energy conservation and self-configuration are primary goals, while per-node fairness and latency are less important. S-MAC uses a few novel techniques to reduce energy consumption and support self-configuration. It enables low-duty-cycle operation in a multihop network. Nodes form virtual clusters based on common sleep schedules to reduce control overhead and enable traffic-adaptive wake-up. S-MAC uses in-channel signaling to avoid overhearing unnecessary traffic. Finally, S-MAC applies message passing to reduce contention latency for applications that require in-network data processing. The paper presents measurement results of S-MAC performance on a sample sensor node, the UC Berkeley Mote, and reveals fundamental tradeoffs on energy, latency and throughput. Results show that S-MAC obtains significant energy savings compared with an 802.11-like MAC without sleeping.citations_number: 3479Citation: Versatile low power media access for wireless sensor networks "Joseph Polastre" "Jason Hill" "David Culler" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5d9d47aa02ceeb84e2a393aaa9d8c0d0无线传感器网络研究进展 "" "" "" "" "" "" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a581e45b0a188ad6e9b80b32a87a8349An energy-efficient MAC protocol for wireless sensor network "Yan-Xiao Li" "Hao-Shan Shi" "Shui-Ping Zhang" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a14018f9e234cc042c239002d55b8bd0Overview of Wireless Sensor Networks "Cui Li" "Miao Yong" "Li Tianpu" "Liu Wei" "Zhao Ze" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=eab535fb122e9d28ea0a75c9ba06a80fEnergy conservation in wireless sensor networks: A survey "Giuseppe Anastasi" "Marco Conti" "Mario Di Francesco" "Andrea Passarella" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6f2b82a43be089edc1f76e1b37e95e51An adaptive energy-efficient and low-latency MAC for data gathering in wireless sensor networks "G.
