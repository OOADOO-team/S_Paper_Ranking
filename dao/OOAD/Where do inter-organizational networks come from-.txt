name: Where do inter-organizational networks come from?url: http://www.jstor.org/stable/info/2990941public_in: 《American Journal of Sociology》authors: Ranjay Gulati,Martin Gargiulo,abstract: Organizations enter alliances with each other to access critical resources, but they rely on information from the network of prior alliances to determine with whom to cooperate. These new alliances modify the existing network, prompting an endogenous dynamic between organizational action and network structure that drives the emergence of interorganizational networks. Testing these ideas on alliances formed in three industries over nine years, this research shows that the probability of a new alliance between specific organizations increases with their interdependence and also with their prior mutual alliances, common third parties, and joint centrality in the alliance network. The differentiation of the emerging network structure, however, mitigates the effect of interdependence and enhances the effect of joint centrality on new alliance formation.citations_number: 2241Citation: Collaboration Networks, Structural Holes, and Innovation: A Longitudinal Study "Gautam Ahuja" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8cf08838ff183960e42486f399bb13a4Structural holes and good ideas "Ronald S. Burt" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3b75a03e25ff3947136d95d0c96f97c8The Network Paradigm in Organizational Research: A Review and Typology "Stephen P.
