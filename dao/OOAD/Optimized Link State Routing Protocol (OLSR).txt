name: Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR)url: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/43076280_Optimized_Link_State_Routing_Protocol_public_in: 《Rfc》authors: CLAUSEN,Thomas,abstract: This document describes the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol for mobile ad hoc networks. The protocol is an optimization of the classical link state algorithm tailored to the requirements of a mobile wireless LAN. The key concept used in the protocol is that of multipoint relays (MPRs). MPRs are selected nodes which forward broadcast messages during the flooding process. This technique substantially reduces the message overhead as compared to a classical flooding mechanism, where every node retransmits each message when it receives the first copy of the message. In OLSR, link state information is generated only by nodes elected as MPRs. Thus, a second optimization is achieved by minimizing the number of control messages flooded in the network. As a third optimization, an MPR node may chose to report only links between itself and its MPR selectors. Hence, as contrary to the classic link state algorithm, partial link state information is distributed in the network. This information is then used for route calculation. OLSR provides optimal routes (in terms of number of hops). The protocol is particularly suitable for large and dense networks as the technique of MPRs works well in this context.citations_number: 6664Citation: Topology Dissemination Based on Reverse-Path Forwarding (TBRPF) "Ogier, R" "Templin, F" "Lewis, M" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b2c9c5030c1be7177f03c1e1d5ecc9b3Interference-Aware Channel Assignment in Multi-Radio Wireless Mesh Networks "K.
