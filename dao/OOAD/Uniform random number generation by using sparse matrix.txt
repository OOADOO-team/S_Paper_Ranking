name: Uniform random number generation by using sparse matrixurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/261161527_Uniform_random_number_generation_by_using_sparse_matrixpublic_in: Information Theory Workshopauthors: Muramatsu, J,Miyake, S,abstract: We investigate the problem of (independent) uniform random number generation and secret key agreement. A generator for the (independent) uniform random numbers is constructed by using a sparse matrix and it is applied to a secret key agreement protocol with strong secrecy. It is proved that the rate of the proposed codes can achieve the fundamental limits.citations_number: 1Citation: General formula for secrecy capacity of wiretap channel with noncausal state "Jun Muramatsu" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d137e25404958734835fb89a220925e6References: Secret key agreement by public discussion from common information "U.
