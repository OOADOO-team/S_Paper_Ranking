name: Adaptive random testing with randomly translated failure regionurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/220854401_Adaptive_random_testing_with_randomly_translated_failure_regionpublic_in: International Workshop on Random Testingauthors: Johannes Mayer,abstract: Adaptive Random Testing (ART) algorithms are designed to be more effective than Random Testing. Some of these methods however distribute the test cases not evenly within the input domain. Therefore, some locations are preferred. Since the locations of failure-causing inputs of a system under test are obviously unkown, such a preference makes the method more effective for some systems under test and less effective for others. This paper addresses the described problem and tries to equalize the effectiveness of a testing method for all systems under test whose failure-causing inputs have the same geometric shape. Virtually, all failure-causing inputs are randomly translated to reach this goal. This method is applied to two well-known ART methods that tend to generate test cases at the corners and the boundary of the input domain more frequently. However, the presented method is not restricted to any strategy for test case selection.citations_number: 9Citation: Comparison of adaptive random testing and random testing under various testing and debugging scenarios "Huai Liu" "Fei-Ching Kuo" "Tsong Yueh Chen" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a9422711f8983d33fbfa3b8d6da7b4edComparison of adaptive random testing and random testing under various testing and debugging scenarios "Huai Liu" "Fei-Ching Kuo" "Tsong Yueh Chen" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=66878793669e6244e3ce5f753ed307e6组合测试用例的自适应随机生成与优先级排序方法研究 "黄如兵" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f0701f97fc8392571741133af6787170基于环形FSCS的MT研究 "耿基鑫" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d3f594cff25335c6135d3f5c91390502自适应随机测试研究 "" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f12144eeb4c3444e21b6b8bbe6c98c2eReferences: Art of Software Testing "Myers, Glenford J" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ff1852596487963e35324000da267f76Massive Stochastic Testing of SQL "Donald R.
