name: A taxonomy of wireless micro-sensor network modelsurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2544177_A_Taxonomy_of_Wireless_Micro-Sensor_Network_Modelspublic_in: ACM SIGMOBILE Mobile Computing and Communications Reviewauthors: Tilak, Sameer, Abu-Ghazaleh, Nael B., Heinzelman, Wendi,abstract: In future smart environments, wireless sensor networks will play a key role in sensing, collecting, and disseminating information about environmental phenomena. Sensing applications represent a new paradigm for network operation, one that has different goals from more traditional wireless networks. This paper examines this emerging field to classify wireless micro-sensor networks according to different communication functions, data delivery models, and network dynamics. This taxonomy will aid in defining appropriate communication infrastructures for different sensor network application sub-spaces, allowing network designers to choose the protocol architecture that best matches the goals of their application. In addition, this taxonomy will enable new sensor network models to be defined for use in further research in this area.citations_number: 2028Citation: 无线传感器网络研究进展 "" "" "" "" "" "" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a581e45b0a188ad6e9b80b32a87a8349传感器网络及其数据管理的概念、问题与进展 "李建中" "李金宝" "石胜飞" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=37998224b93f0b44f4f808dd6871ce53Internet of Things (IoT): A vision, architectural elements, and future directions "Jayavardhana Gubbi" "Rajkumar Buyya" "Slaven Marusic" "Marimuthu Palaniswami" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=72ad451eca590b761b9a6e31b0e897d7Overview of Wireless Sensor Networks "Cui Li" "Miao Yong" "Li Tianpu" "Liu Wei" "Zhao Ze" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=eab535fb122e9d28ea0a75c9ba06a80fThe design space of wireless sensor networks "Römer, Kay" "Mattern, Friedemann" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d4c20004074290e063a8c4e69d47a619Ultra-wideband communications: an idea whose time has come "Liuqing Yang" "Giannakis, G.B" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7d9366c0fa4cd6fe634561e1c8ec9689Ultra-wideband communications: an idea whose time has come "G.B.
