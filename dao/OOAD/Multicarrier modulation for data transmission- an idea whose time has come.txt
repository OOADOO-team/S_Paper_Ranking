name: Multicarrier modulation for data transmission: an idea whose time has comeurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/3194857_Multicarrier_modulation_for_data_transmission_an_idea_whose_time_has_comepublic_in: IEEE Communications Magazineauthors: Bingham, J.A.C.,abstract: The general technique of parallel transmission on many carriers,  called multicarrier modulation (MCM), is explained. The performance that  can be achieved on an undistorted channel and algorithms for achieving  that performance are discussed. Ways of dealing with channel impairments  and of improving the performance through coding are described, and  implementation methods are considered. Duplex operation of MCM and the  possible use of this on the general switched telephone network are  examinedcitations_number: 5346Citation: Technique for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing frequency offset correction "Moose, Paul H" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=79a135cc2d9298104a421306701e966aML estimation of time and frequency offset in OFDM systems.
