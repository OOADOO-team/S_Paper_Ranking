name: Empirical study of particle swarm optimizationurl: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/abstractKeywords.jsp?reload=true&amp;arnumber=785511public_in: Noneauthors: Shi, Y,Eberhart, R.C,abstract: Abstract A single particle structure of the classical particle swarm optimization was analyzed which was found to have some properties of a Chaos-Hopfield neural network. A new model of the particle swarm optimization was proposed. The model is a deterministic Chaos-Hopfield neural network swarm which is different from the existing one with stochastic parameters. Its search orbits show an evolution process of inverse period bifurcation from chaos to periodic orbits then to sink. In this evolution process, the initial chaos-like search expands the optimal scope, and inverse period bifurcation determines the stability and convergence of the search. Moreover, the convergence is theoretically analyzed. Finally, the numerical simulation shows the difference between the chaotic particle swarm optimization and the classical particle swarm optimization; and it also demonstrates the efficiency of the presented technique.citations_number: 4452Citation: The particle swarm - explosion, stability, and convergence in a multidimensional complex space "Kennedy, J" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=442c3c8510d60e65cbec52167615b598Particle swarm optimization: developments, applications and resources "Eberhart" "Yuhui Shi" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dbf8d0f3bcec28c75b189486c792ab69Particle Swarm Optimization "James Kennedy" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=eb40759403feeef832553238bd39b2e1Self-organizing hierarchical particle swarm optimizer with time-varying acceleration coefficients "A.
