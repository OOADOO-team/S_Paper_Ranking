name: Self-perceived psychological stress in relation to psychosocial factors and work in a random population sample of womenurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_JJ028058477public_in: 《Stress &amp; Health》authors: Jönsson, Dagmar,Johansson, Saga,Rosengren, Annika,abstract: Objective: To investigate the relations between stress and other psychosocial factors, and to compare stress levels registered at 18 years&#039; interval.Methods: In 1980 1413 women aged 37 to 65 years were examined (81 per cent of a random population sample). In 1997 to 1998 909 of the women were re-examined. Psychological stress was graded 1 to 6.Results: Work-related factors, i.e. employment including work leadership, demands of high concentration at work, dissatisfaction with work content and dissatisfaction with work environment were each independently associated with severe self-perceived psychological stress in the 1980 survey (OR (95%Cl) = 1.85(1.28-2.70), 1.55(1.11-2.16), 5.06(2.38-10.77) and 2.11(1.23-3.61)), respectively. Family-related factors such as difficulties in agreeing with husband/cohabitant were also closely related to severe stress (OR (95%CI) = 3.39(1.07-10.75)). Other factors independently related to severe stress were smoking (OR (95%CI) = 1.42(1.03-1.98) and 2.40(1.24-4.65) at the first and second investigations respectively). Psychological stress was lower in physically active women (OR (95%CI) = 0.47(0.35-0.66) and 0.43(0.23-0.80) at the first and second investigations respectively). Blood pressure and serum cholesterol were lower in women at higher stress levels in several age groups. There was a general decrease of the self-perceived stress level between the first and the second investigation. In women aged 55 to 64 years, however, the only age group that were available for analysis on both occasions, more severe stress was reported at the second investigation (13.8 versus 16.8 per cent; p &lt; 0.0001).citations_number: 26Citation: The Effects of Stress on Physical Activity and Exercise "Matthew A.
