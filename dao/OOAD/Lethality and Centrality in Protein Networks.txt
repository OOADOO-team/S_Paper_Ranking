name: Lethality and Centrality in Protein Networksurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM11333967public_in: Natureauthors: JEONG,H.,abstract: In this paper we present the first mathematical analysis of the protein interaction network found in the yeast, S. cerevisiae. We show that, (a) the identified protein network display a characteristic scale-free topology that demonstrate striking similarity to the inherent organization of metabolic networks in particular, and to that of robust and error-tolerant networks in general. (b) the likelihood that deletion of an individual gene product will prove lethal for the yeast cell clearly correlates with the number of interactions the protein has, meaning that highly-connected proteins are more likely to prove essential than proteins with low number of links to other proteins. These results suggest that a scale-free architecture is a generic property of cellular networks attributable to universal self-organizing principles of robust and error-tolerant networks and that will likely to represent a generic topology for protein-protein interactions.Jeong, H; Mason, S P; Barabási, A L; Oltvai, Z Ncitations_number: 4705Citation: 2002): “Statistical mechanics of complex networks "Réka Albert" "Albert-László Barabási" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=97250f86fca0e2aa57af0c72c1f99bb4Statistical mechanics of complex networks "Réka Albert" "AlbertLászló Barabási" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=09de58bced0f9e3d9cc6a9e1cf2dce65Error and attack tolerance of complex networks "Albert R" "Jeong H" "Barabasi AL" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=97d3251a350c29b948480679c8f98956Complex networks: Structure and dynamics "Volpp, Leti" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1f8d04f040a4af860008e7e32d063f43Core transcriptional regulatory circuitry in human embryonic stem cells.
