name: Sensing by Random Convolutionurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/4330720_Sensing_by_Random_Convolutionpublic_in: IEEE International Workshop on Computational Advances in Multi-sensor Adaptive Processingauthors: Justin Romberg,abstract: Several recent results in compressive sampling (CS) show that a sparse signal (i.e. one which can be compressed in a known orthobasis) can be efficiently acquired by taking linear measurements against random test functions. In practice, however, it is difficult to build sensing devices which take these types of measurements. In this paper, we will show how to extend some of the results in CS to measurement systems which are more amenable to real-world implementation. In particular, we will show that taking measurements by subsampling a convolution with a random pulse is in some sense a universal compressive sampling strategy. We finish by briefly discussing how these results suggest a novel imaging architecture.citations_number: 77Citation: Beyond Nyquist: Efficient Sampling of Sparse Bandlimited Signals "Tropp, Joel A" "Laska, Jason N" "Duarte, Marco F" "Romberg, Justin K" "Baraniuk, Richard G" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0280b65bbcfaa480bc31ef95e9f65ae1Signal Processing With Compressive Measurements "M.
