name: Efficient privatization of random bits.url: http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1660447public_in: 《Workshop on Randomized Algorithms》authors: Zimand, Marius,abstract: ABSTRACT  The paper investigates the extent to which a public source of random bits can be used to obtain private random bits that can be safely used in cryptographic protocols. This process is called privatization of random bits. We consider the case in which the party privatizing random bits has a small number of private random bits. Using techniques from the theory of pseudo-random generators and finely tailoring them for the specifics of this problem, we show that starting with cn private bits and using a long but public random string, one can produce 2 dn random bits that cannot be distinguished (but with exponentially small bias) from real random bits by any adversary circuits of size 2 0:499n . Keywords: one-way function, pseudo-random generator, random bits. 1 Introduction It is commonly accepted that random bits are a valuable computational resource. Unfortunately, random bits are hard and expensive to produce.
