name: A new optimizer using particle swarm theoryurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/3627756_New_optimizer_using_particle_swarm_theorypublic_in: MHS&#039;95. Proceedings of the Sixth International Symposium on Micro Machine and Human Scienceauthors: R. Eberhart,J. Kennedy,abstract: The optimization of nonlinear functions using particle swarm methodology is described. Implementations of two paradigms are discussed and compared, including a recently developed locally oriented paradigm. Benchmark testing of both paradigms is described, and applications, including neural network training and robot task learning, are proposed. Relationships between particle swarm optimization and both artificial life and evolutionary computation are reviewed.citations_number: 1Citation: Particle swarm optimization "J. Kennedy" "R.
