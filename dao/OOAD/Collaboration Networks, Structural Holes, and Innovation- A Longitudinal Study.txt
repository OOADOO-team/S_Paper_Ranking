name: Collaboration Networks, Structural Holes, and Innovation: A Longitudinal Studyurl: http://www.jstor.org/stable/2667105public_in: 《Administrative Science Quarterly》authors: Ahuja, Gautam,abstract: To assess the effects of a firm&#039;s network of relations on innovation, this paper elaborates a theoretical framework that relates three aspects of a firm&#039;s ego network-direct ties, indirect ties, and structural holes (disconnections between a firm&#039;s partners)-to the firm&#039;s subsequent innovation output. It posits that direct and indirect ties both have a positive impact on innovation but that the impact of indirect ties is moderated by the number of a firm&#039;s direct ties. Structural holes are proposed to have both positive and negative influences on subsequent innovation. Results from a longitudinal study of firms in the international chemicals industry indicate support for the predictions on direct and indirect ties, but in the interfirm collaboration network, increasing structural holes has a negative effect on innovation. Among the implications for interorganizational network theory is that the optimal structure of interfirm networks depends on the objectives of the network members.citations_number: 3727Citation: Open for innovation: the role of openness in explaining innovation performance among U.K. manufacturing firms "Keld Laursen" "Ammon Salter" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e6a17f8c174fc6151ba95316511e4205Something Old, Something New: A Longitudinal Study of Search Behavior and New Product Introduction "Riitta Katila" "Gautam Ahuja" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fd8e65580f63cf6a56d25caf7a45a50fThe Influence of Intellectual Capital on the Types of Innovative Capabilities "Mohan Subramaniam" "Mark A.
