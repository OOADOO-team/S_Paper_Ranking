name: TOSSIM:accurate and scalable simulation of entire TinyOS applicationsurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2889938_TOSSIM_Accurate_and_Scalable_Simulation_of_Entire_TinyOS_Applicationspublic_in: Proc of the Acm Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systemsauthors: Philip Levis,Nelson Lee,Matt Welsh,abstract: Accurate and scalable simulation has historically been a key enabling factor for systems research. We present TOSSIM, a simulator for TinyOS wireless sensor networks. By exploiting the sensor network domain and TinyOS&#039;s design, TOSSIM can capture network behavior at a high fidelity while scaling to thousands of nodes. By using a probabilistic bit error model for the network, TOSSIM remains simple and efficient, but expressive enough to capture a wide range of network interactions. Using TOSSIM, we have discovered several bugs in TinyOS, ranging from network bit-level MAC interactions to queue overflows in an ad-hoc routing protocol. Through these and other evaluations, we show that detailed, scalable sensor network simulation is possible.citations_number: 2492Citation: 无线传感器网络研究进展 "" "" "" "" "" "" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a581e45b0a188ad6e9b80b32a87a8349Wireless Sensor Networks: An Information Processing Approach "Jessica Mytum-Smithson" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cbbbcdc4d0241e985d5b3361ae73cebcAvrora: scalable sensor network simulation with precise timing "Titzer, B.L" "Lee, D.K" "Palsberg, J" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8e537856ee25e435ead45d86a4d721e8MoteLab:a wireless sensor network testbed "Geoffrey Werner-Allen" "Patrick Swieskowski" "Matt Welsh" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8b364057a6027365bd2b88918ef1dadaAvrora: scalable sensor network simulation with precise timing "Titzer, Ben L" "Lee, Daniel K" "Palsberg, Jens" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2cc5dbdc696172fc94b690aabf565a27VigilNet: An Integrated Sensor Network System for Energy-Efficient Surveillance "He, Tian" "Krishnamurthy, Sudha" "Luo, Liqian" "Yan, Ting" "Gu, Lin" "Stoleru, Radu" "Zhou, Gang" "Cao, Qing" "Vicaire, Pascal" "Stankovic, John A" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d60326da8136e9966e3abdd003931f62EmStar: a software environment for developing and deploying wireless sensor networks "Lewis Girod" "Jeremy Elson" "Alberto Cerpa" "Thanos Stathopoulos" "Nithya Ramanathan" "Deborah Estrin" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=08242a687b488f0fb53871731c75ae95Cross-Level Sensor Network Simulation with COOJA "F.
