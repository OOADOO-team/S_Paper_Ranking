J,Kaiser, W. J,abstract: During the WINS NG program, three generations of networked embedded sensor development systems were created, with over 180 of these systems provided to both the SensIT and NRL SRSS development communities. In addition to the supply of development systems, throughout this contract, support was provided to multiple teams of developers investigating various problems in collaborative signal processing, autonomous networking, and distributed operations for wireless networked sensor systems. Multiple types of sensor systems were developed and provided including capabilities for acoustic, seismic, passive infrared detection, and visual imaging. These systems were demonstrated as multiple tests and experiments by multiple groups Sensoria was supporting for each of the three years of this program.citations_number: 4506Citation: Secure routing in wireless sensor networks: attacks and countermeasures "C.
