name: Genome Wide Association Analysis of the 16th QTL- MAS Workshopdataset using the Random Forest machine learning approachurl: http://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1753-6561-8-S5-S4public_in: BMC Proceedingsauthors: Minozzi, Giulietta,Pedretti, Andrea,Biffani, Stefano,abstract: Background: Genome wide association studies are now widely used in the livestock sector to estimate the association among single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed across the whole genome and one or more trait. As computational power increases, the use of machine learning techniques to analyze large genome widedatasets becomes possible. Methods: The objective of this study was to identify SNPs associatedwith the three traits simulated in the 16th MAS-QTL workshop dataset using the Random Forest (RF) approach. The approach was applied to single and multiple trait estimated breeding values, and on yield deviations and to compare them with the results of the GRAMMAR-CG method. Results: The two QTL mapping methods used, GRAMMAR-CG and RF, were successful in identifying the main QTLs for trait 1 on chromosomes 1 and 4, for trait 2 on chromosomes 1, 4 and 5 and for trait 3 on chromosomes 1, 2 and 3. Conclusions: The results of the RF approach were confirmed by the GRAMMAR-CG method and validated by the effective QTL position, even if their approach to unravel cryptic genetic structure is different. Furthermore, both methods showed complementary findings. However, when the variance explained by the QTL is low, they both failed to detect significant associations.citations_number: 6Citation: Genome wide association analysis of the 16th QTL- MAS Workshop dataset using the Random Forest machine learning approach "Minozzi G" "Pedretti A" "Biffani S" "Nicolazzi EL" "Stella A" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=856ebd5a7f5113f27f264df08786fe9dXVI th QTLMAS: simulated dataset and comparative analysis of submitted results for QTL mapping and genomic evaluation "M Graziano Usai" "Giustino Gaspa" "Nicolò PP Macciotta" "Antonello Carta" "Sara Casu" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=07121bc3b82b9bdcd9fe0fe8cdf2b2d6尾分析法在不同规模群体中开展全基因组关联研究 "武群清" "张龙超" "黄生强" "王立贤" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c6c1ce5eb9a00c893fbbbd44a15a6c52An efficient unified model for genome-wide association studies and genomic selection "Hengde Li" "Guosheng Su" "Li Jiang" "Zhenmin Bao" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=800352005ee500aae140f2f492c1c4d3References: GenABEL: an R library for genome-wide association analysis "Aulchenko YS" "Ripke S" "Isaacs A" "van Duijn CM" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=212d5e0a499c0b2c3e0cfea1aa73b91fBLUPF90 and related programs (BGF90).
