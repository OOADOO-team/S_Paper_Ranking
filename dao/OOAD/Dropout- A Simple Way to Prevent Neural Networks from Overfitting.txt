name: Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfittingurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/286794765_Dropout_A_simple_way_to_prevent_neural_networks_from_overfittingpublic_in: Journal of Machine Learning Researchauthors: Srivastava, Nitish,Hinton, Geoffrey,Krizhevsky, Alex,abstract: Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different &quot;thinned&quot; networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.citations_number: 3601Citation: Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift "Ioffe, Sergey" "Szegedy, Christian" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4634f864791a3f3a0817edabeacf4c49Batch normalization: accelerating deep network training by reducing internal covariate shift "Sergey Ioffe" "Christian Szegedy" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b8560be312f2a6d7b3b7f9c6e7714c78Delving Deep into Rectifiers: Surpassing Human-Level Performance on ImageNet Classification "Kaiming He" "Xiangyu Zhang" "Shaoqing Ren" "Jian Sun" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3a09af49af167b573232c4361876052bDensely Connected Convolutional Networks "Huang, Gao" "Liu, Zhuang" "van der Maaten, Laurens" "Weinberger, Kilian Q." http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c8482c3b8fed1b2a8adc6189ffef3ec3Densely Connected Convolutional Networks "Gao Huang" "Zhuang Liu" "Laurens van der Maaten" "Kilian Q.
