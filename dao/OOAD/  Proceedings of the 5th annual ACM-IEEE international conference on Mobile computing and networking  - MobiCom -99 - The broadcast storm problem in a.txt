In a mobile ad hoc network ( MANET ) in particular, due to host mobility, such operations are expected to be executed more frequently (such as finding a route to a particular host, paging a particular host, and sending an alarm signal). Because radio signals are likely to overlap with others in a geographical area, a straightforward broadcasting by flooding is usually very costly and will result in serious redundancy, contention, and collision, to which we call the broadcast storm  problem. In this paper, we identify this problem by showing how serious it is through analyses and simulations. We propose several schemes to reduce redundant rebroadcasts and differentiate timing of rebroadcasts to alleviate this problem. Simulation results are presented, which show different levels of improvement over the basic flooding approach.citations_number: 3654Citation: Comparison of broadcasting techniques for mobile ad hoc networks "Brad Williams" "Tracy Camp" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6871a3b5e28749b77ffc38750713eb07Gossip-based ad hoc routing "Haas, Zygmunt" "Halpern, Joseph Y" "Li, Li" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4b7ae08a392ecd0ebf95ede75d069457DTN routing as a resource allocation problem "Aruna Balasubramanian" "Brian Levine" "Arun Venkataramani" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=295b5cf11d79d0391e8cefefbf4ed091A new multi-channel MAC protocol with on-demand channel assignment for multi-hop mobile ad hoc networks "Shih-Lin Wu" "Chih-Yu Lin" "Yu-Chee Tseng" "Jang-Laing Sheu" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5745604a6849694865ee46d9fb3fcbf8Dominating Sets and Neighbor Elimination-Based Broadcasting Algorithms in Wireless Networks "Ivan Stojmenovic" "Mahtab Seddigh" "Jovisa Zunic" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f7f6a3d27fa31b2ed891e4c17d52728fMultipoint relaying for flooding broadcast messages in mobile wireless networks "A.
