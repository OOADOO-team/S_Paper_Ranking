name: Thimble regularization at work: From toy models to chiral random matrix theoriesurl: http://ptep.oxfordjournals.org/external-ref?access_num=1507.03858&amp;link_type=ARXIVpublic_in: Physical Review Dauthors: Di Renzo, F., Eruzzi, G.,abstract: We apply the Lefschetz thimble formulation of field theories to a couple of different problems. We first address the solution of a complex 0-dimensional phi^4 theory. Although very simple, this toy-model makes us appreciate a few key issues of the method. In particular, we will solve the model by a correct accounting of all the thimbles giving a contribution to the partition function and we will discuss a number of algorithmic solutions to simulate this (simple) model. We will then move to a chiral random matrix (CRM) theory. This is a somehow more realistic setting, giving us once again the chance to tackle the same couple of fundamental questions: how many thimbles contribute to the solution? how can we make sure that we correctly sample configurations on the thimble? Since the exact result is known for the observable we study (a condensate), we can verify that, in the region of parameters we studied, only one thimble contributes and that the algorithmic solution that we set up works well, despite its very crude nature. The deviation of results from phase quenched results highlights that in a certain region of parameter space there is a quite important sign problem. In view of this, the success of our thimble approach is quite a significant one.citations_number: 20Citation: The argument for justification of the complex Langevin method and the condition for correct convergence "Keitaro Nagata" "Jun Nishimura" "Shinji Shimasaki" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4b151a07b08f39fb38df493fac041a20Lefschetz thimble structure in one-dimensional lattice Thirring model at finite density "Hirotsugu Fujii" "Syo Kamata" "Yoshio Kikukawa" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=806decf558716fea45117a5e390c2b35Hamilton dynamics for Lefschetz-thimble integration akin to the complex Langevin method "Kenji Fukushima" "Yuya Tanizaki" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=81baeb4ef30864eb1654f9045a23faecJustification of the complex Langevin method with the gauge cooling procedure "Keitaro Nagata" "Jun Nishimura" "Shinji Shimasaki" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9f5e0c20e2ab8771c3c32cf36888c00bComplex saddle points and the sign problem in complex Langevin simulation "Tomoya Hayata" "Yoshimasa Hidaka" "Yuya Tanizaki" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ac3c7ad2a70ed218e1bd04d39decdf95Monte Carlo study of Lefschetz thimble structure in one-dimensional Thirring model at finite density "Hirotsugu Fujii" "Syo Kamata" "Yoshio Kikukawa" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=05eea6400972d097316921e995ba3c80Gauge cooling for the singular-drift problem in the complex Langevin method — a test in Random Matrix Theory for finite density QCD "Keitaro Nagata" "Jun Nishimura" "Shinji Shimasaki" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ed55071ded82138f04cec6e1a04a115fResurgence Structure to All Orders of Multi-bions in Deformed SUSY Quantum Mechanics "Toshiaki Fujimori" "Syo Kamata" "Tatsuhiro Misumi" "Muneto Nitta" "Norisuke Sakai" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cda0625c5257236bc07bfb10a741b6f1Multi-flavor massless QED 2 at finite densities via Lefschetz thimbles "Yuya Tanizaki" "Motoi Tachibana" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=373a21ab7d7f2949cf07a8e70365285cSimulating low dimensional QCD with Lefschetz thimbles "Christian Schmidt" "Felix Ziesché" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3beb164de3dee90bf315ccf01af24eadReferences: Spectrum of the QCD Dirac operator and chiral random matrix theory "Verbaarschot J" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=431af8491d462928650a19f6f2be00dfAnalytic Continuation Of Chern-Simons Theory "Witten, Edward" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3988939efae730dec9141d2bfaedf48eAn efficient method to compute the residual phase on a Lefschetz thimble "M.
