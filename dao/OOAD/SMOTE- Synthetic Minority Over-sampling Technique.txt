name: SMOTE: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Techniqueurl: http://www.oalib.com/paper/4014666public_in: 《Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research》authors: Chawla, N. V.,Bowyer, K. W.,Hall, L. O.,abstract: Abstract:  An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of &quot;normal&quot; examples with only a small percentage of &quot;abnormal&quot; or &quot;interesting&quot; examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal (interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority (abnormal) class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.citations_number: 4722Citation: SMOTE: synthetic minority over-sampling technique "Nitesh V.
