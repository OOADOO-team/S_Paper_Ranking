name: On the self-similar nature of Ethernet trafficurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221164419_On_the_Self-Similar_Nature_of_Ethernet_Trafficpublic_in: ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Reviewauthors: Leland, Will E., Willinger, Walter, Taqqu, Murad S.,abstract: We demonstrate that Ethernet local area network (LAN) traffic is statistically self-similar, that none of the commonly used traffic models is able to capture this fractal behavior, and that such behavior has serious implications for the design, control, and analysis of high-speed, cell-based networks. Intuitively, the critical characteristic of this self-similar traffic is that there is no natural length of a &quot;burst&quot;: at every time scale ranging from a few milliseconds to minutes and hours, similar-looking traffic bursts are evident; we find that aggregating streams of such traffic typically intensifies the self-similarity (&quot;burstiness&quot;) instead of smoothing it.Our conclusions are supported by a rigorous statistical analysis of hundreds of millions of high quality Ethernet traffic measurements collected between 1989 and 1992, coupled with a discussion of the underlying mathematical and statistical properties of self-similarity and their relationship with actual network behavior. We also consider some implications for congestion control in high-bandwidth networks and present traffic models based on self-similar stochastic processes that are simple, accurate, and realistic for aggregate traffic.citations_number: 8565Citation: On the self-similar nature of Ethernet traffic (extended version) "W.E.
