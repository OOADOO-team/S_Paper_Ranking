name: Discrete and continuous models for in plane loaded random elastic brickworkurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0997753808001101public_in: European Journal of Mechanics / A Solidsauthors: Cecchi, A,Sab, K,abstract: The aim of this paper is to study non-periodic masonries – typical of historical buildings – by means of a perturbation approach and to evaluate the effect of a random perturbation on the elastic response of a periodic masonry wall. The random masonry is obtained starting from a periodic running bond pattern. A random perturbation on the horizontal positions of the vertical interfaces between the blocks which form the masonry wall is introduced. In this way, the height of the blocks is uniform, while their width in the horizontal direction is random. The perturbation is limited such as each block has still exactly 6 neighboring blocks. In a first discrete model, the blocks are modeled as rigid bodies connected by elastic interfaces (mortar thin joints). In other words, masonry is seen as a “skeleton” in which the interactions between the rigid blocks are represented by forces and moments which depend on their relative displacements and rotations. A second continuous model is based on the homogenization of the discrete model. Explicit upper and lower bounds on the effective elastic moduli of the homogenized continuous model are obtained and compared to the well-known effective elastic moduli of the regular periodic masonry. It is found that the effective moduli are not very sensitive to the random perturbation (less than 10%). At the end, the Monte Carlo simulation method is used to compare the discrete random model and the continuous model at the structural level (a panel undergoing in plane actions). The randomness of the geometry requires the generation of several samples of size L of the discrete masonry. For a sample of size L, the structural discrete problem is solved using the same numerical procedure adopted in [Cecchi, A., Sab, K., 2004. A comparison between a 3D discrete model and two homogenized plate models for periodic elastic brickwork, International Journal of Solids Structures 41 (9–10), 2259–2276] and the average solution over the samples gives an estimation which depends on L. As L increases, an asymptotic limit is reached. One issue is to find the minimum size for L and to compare the asymptotic average solution to the one obtained from the continuous homogenized model.citations_number: 22Citation: A simplified homogenized limit analysis model for randomly assembled blocks out-of-plane loaded "Milani, Gabriele" "Louren" "o, Paulo B" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=77963b00a52f5dd29d6cc2a3ecc2daacA multi-scale enriched model for the analysis of masonry panels "Daniela Addessi" "Elio Sacco" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7742c5fe221e56c333afb16d6850fca8Monte Carlo homogenized limit analysis model for randomly assembled blocks in-plane loaded "Gabriele Milani" "Paulo B.
