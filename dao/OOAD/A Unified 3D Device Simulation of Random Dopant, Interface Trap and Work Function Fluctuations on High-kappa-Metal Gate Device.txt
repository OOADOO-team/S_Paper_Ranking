name: A Unified 3D Device Simulation of Random Dopant, Interface Trap and Work Function Fluctuations on High-kappa/Metal Gate Deviceurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/239764265_A_unified_3D_device_simulation_of_random_dopant_interface_trap_and_work_function_fluctuations_on_high-metal_gate_device?ev=auth_pubpublic_in: 《Electron Devices Meeting .iedm.technical Digest.international》authors: Li, Yiming,Cheng, HuiWen,Chiu, YungYueh,abstract: In this work, we for the first time estimate total fluctuation resulting from random dopants (RDs), interface trap (ITs) and work functions (WKs) using experimentally calibrated 3D device simulation on 16-nm-gate high-kappa/metal gate devices. The total 3D simulated threshold voltage fluctuation (sigma V-th), induced by the aforementioned random sources simultaneously, is 55.5 mV for NMOS; however, a statistical total sum of these fluctuations is 12.3% overestimation because independence assumption on random variables is invalid owing to strong interactions among RDs, ITs and WKs. Device&#039;s DC/AC and CMOS SRAM circuit fluctuations have similar observation. FinFET-based structure innovation possessing large fluctuation suppression (sigma V-th = 30.2 mV; 45.6% reduction), compared with process efforts on planar one, is further discussed.citations_number: 15Citation: Work-Function Variation Effects of Tunneling Field-Effect Transistors (TFETs) "Kyoung Min Choi" "Woo Young Choi" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=61c51f37d86cdab2a86e349b470c8f3aDrain-induced-barrier lowering and subthreshold swing fluctuations in 16-nm-gate bulk FinFET devices induced by random discrete dopants "Hsin-Wen Su" "Yiming Li" "Yu-Yu Chen" "Chieh-Yang Chen" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=46105750d9cd825309a1496cafb99ed9On characteristic variability of 16-nm-gate bulk FinFET devices induced by intrinsic parameter fluctuation and process variation effect "Chieh-Yang Chen" "Yiming Li" "Yu-Yu Chen" "Han-Tung Chang" "Sheng-Chia Hsu" "Wen-Tsung Huang" "Chin-Min Yang" "Li-Wen Chen" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=bed565a5af24e9de5161d8b75e715d64Statistical device simulation of intrinsic parameter fluctuation in 16-nm-gate n- and p-type Bulk FinFETs "Yu-Yu Chen" "Wen-Tsung Huang" "Sheng-Chia Hsu" "Han-Tung Chang" "Chieh-Yang Chen" "Chin-Min Yang" "Li-Wen Chen" "Yiming Li" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f936e5d338d5364bd779173a1884e8eeImpact of Random Interface Traps and Random Dopants in High-$k$ \/Metal Gate Junctionless FETs "Yijiao Wang" "Peng Huang" "Kangliang Wei" "Lang Zeng" "Xiaoyan Liu" "Gang Du" "Xing Zhang" "Jinfeng Kang" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6a60f34823d7b9bd52d719654fd4efbbElectrical characteristic and power consumption fluctuations of trapezoidal bulk FinFET devices and circuits induced by random line edge roughness "Chieh-Yang Chen" "Wen-Tsung Huang" "Yiming Li" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=337eb4cd8e1e0fc24a40d3d144720961Simulation of the effect of arsenic discrete distribution on device characteristics in silicon nanowire transistors "Masashi Uematsu" "Kohei M.
