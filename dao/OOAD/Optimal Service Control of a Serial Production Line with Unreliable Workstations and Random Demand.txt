name: Optimal Service Control of a Serial Production Line with Unreliable Workstations and Random Demandurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005109898000508public_in: Automaticaauthors: DONG-PING SONG, YOU-XIAN SUN,abstract: The problem considered is to find the optimal service control  policy for a serial production line with n failure-prone workstations  and random demand. The processing times of the part in workstations are exponentially distributed, and the service rates are controllable if the  workstations are up. The objective function is the expected discounted  cost caused by inventories of work-in-process and inventory or backlog  of finished products. It is shown that the optimal policy is of  bang-bang type and can be determined by a set of switching manifolds.  For a given state of the workstations, one manifold determines the  optimal decision of one workstation while it is up. The monotonicity and  asymptotic behaviors of the manifolds are investigated. The relationship  of the manifolds under different workstation states is studied, i.e. the  more the workstations are down, the lower the switching manifolds locale  in the state space. Based on the structural properties of the switching  manifolds, some simple suboptimal policies are proposed, which are quite  easy to implement in practical systems. Numeric examples are given to illustrate the resultscitations_number: 21Citation: Dynamic modeling and control of supply chain systems: A review "Haralambos Sarimveis" "Panagiotis Patrinos" "Chris D.
