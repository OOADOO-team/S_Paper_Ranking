name: Speech recognitionwith segmental conditional random fields: A summary of the JHU CLSP 2010 Summer Workshopurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/224246437_Speech_recognitionwith_segmental_conditional_random_fields_A_summary_of_the_JHU_CLSP_2010_Summer_Workshoppublic_in: IEEE International Conference on Acousticsauthors: G. Zweig,P. Nguyen,D. Van Compernolle,abstract: This paper summarizes the 2010 CLSP Summer Workshop on speech recognition at Johns Hopkins University. The key theme of the workshop was to improve on state-of-the-art speech recognition systems by using Segmental Conditional Random Fields (SCRFs) to integrate multiple types of information. This approach uses a state of-the-art baseline as a springboard from which to add a suite of novel features including ones derived from acoustic templates, deep neural net phoneme detections, duration models, modulation features, and whole word point-process models. The SCRF framework is able to appropriately weight these different information sources to produce significant gains on both die Broadcast News and Wall Street Journal tasks.citations_number: 46Citation: Deep Neural Networks for Acoustic Modeling in Speech Recognition: The Shared Views of Four Research Groups "Geoffrey Hinton" "Li Deng" "Dong Yu" "George E.
