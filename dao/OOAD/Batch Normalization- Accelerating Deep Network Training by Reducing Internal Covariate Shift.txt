name: Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shifturl: http://www.oalib.com/paper/4071527public_in: Noneauthors: Ioffe, Sergey,Szegedy, Christian,abstract: Abstract:  Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer&#039;s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5 validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.citations_number: 3324Citation: Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition "Kaiming He" "Xiangyu Zhang" "Shaoqing Ren" "Jian Sun" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3821a90f58762386e257eb4e6fa11f79Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition "Kaiming He" "Xiangyu Zhang" "Shaoqing Ren" "Jian Sun" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=0bbb6ce3c1665e19ef5043a5aad7cdc4Delving Deep into Rectifiers: Surpassing Human-Level Performance on ImageNet Classification "Kaiming He" "Xiangyu Zhang" "Shaoqing Ren" "Jian Sun" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3a09af49af167b573232c4361876052bRethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision "Christian Szegedy" "Vincent Vanhoucke" "Sergey Ioffe" "Jon Shlens" "Zbigniew Wojna" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=85cb5951532d848275b14ca24b9c95d7Identity Mappings in Deep Residual Networks "Kaiming He" "Xiangyu Zhang" "Shaoqing Ren" "Jian Sun" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=398b4043e5948b471a7b9b521f0a1d50SSD: Single Shot MultiBox Detector "Wei Liu" "Dragomir Anguelov" "Dumitru Erhan" "Christian Szegedy" "Scott Reed" "Cheng-Yang Fu" "Alexander C.
