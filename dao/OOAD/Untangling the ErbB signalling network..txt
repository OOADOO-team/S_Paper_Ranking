name: Untangling the ErbB signalling network.url: http://www.nature.com/nrm/journal/v2/n2/abs/nrm0201_127a.htmlpublic_in: 《Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol》authors: Yarden Y,abstract: Abstract When epidermal growth factor and its relatives bind the ErbB family of receptors, they trigger a rich network of signalling pathways, culminating in responses ranging from cell division to death, motility to adhesion. The network is often dysregulated in cancer and lends credence to the mantra that molecular understanding yields clinical benefit: over 25,000 women with breast cancer have now been treated with trastuzumab (Herceptin), a recombinant antibody designed to block the receptor ErbB2. Likewise, small-molecule enzyme inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies to ErbB1 are in advanced phases of clinical testing. What can this pathway teach us about translating basic science into clinical use?citations_number: 6089Citation: Untangling the ErbB signaling network "Yarden Y" "Sliwkowski MX" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e65343644c0cd33b133ad98180755a5bPredicting Sensitivity of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer to Gefitinib: Is There a Role for P-Akt?
