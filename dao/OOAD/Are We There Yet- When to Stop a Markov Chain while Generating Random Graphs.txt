name: Are We There Yet? When to Stop a Markov Chain while Generating Random Graphsurl: http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-30541-2_12public_in: International Workshop on Algorithms &amp; Models for the Web-graphauthors: Jaideep Ray,Ali Pinar,C. Seshadhri,abstract: Markov chains are convenient means of generating realizations of networks with a given (joint or otherwise) degree distribution, since they simply require a procedure for rewiring edges. The major challenge is to find the right number of steps to run such a chain, so that we generate truly independent samples. Theoretical bounds for mixing times of these Markov chains are too large to be practically useful. Practitioners have no useful guide for choosing the length, and tend to pick numbers fairly arbitrarily. We give a principled mathematical argument showing that it suffices for the length to be proportional to the number of desired number of edges. We also prescribe a method for choosing this proportionality constant. We run a series of experiments showing that the distributions of common graph properties converge in this time, providing empirical evidence for our claims.citations_number: 15Citation: Are we there yet? when to stop a Markov chain while generating random graphs.
