name: Social Support as a Moderator of Life Stressurl: http://www.tandfonline.com/servlet/linkout?suffix=CIT0008&amp;dbid=16&amp;doi=10.1080%2F10376178.2017.1368401&amp;key=10.1097%2F00006842-197609000-00003public_in: Psychosomatic Medicineauthors: Cobb, Sidney,abstract: Social support is defined as information leading the subject to believe that he is cared for and loved, esteemed, and a member of a network of mutual obligations. The evidence that supportive interactions among people are protective against the health consequences of life stress is reviewed. It appears that social support can protect people in crisis from a wide variety of pathological states: from low birth weight to death, from arthritis through tuberculosis to depression, alcoholism, and the social breakdown syndrome. Furthermore, social support may reduce the amount of medication required, accelerate recovery, and facilitate compliance with prescribed medical regimens.citations_number: 4083Citation: Stress, Social Support, and the Buffering Hypothesis "Cohen S" "Wills TA" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a89def29415c1b9378fd59d0cb8cd72dIf it changes it must be a process: study of emotion and coping during three stages of a college examination.
