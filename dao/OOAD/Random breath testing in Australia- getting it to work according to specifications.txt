name: Random breath testing in Australia: getting it to work according to specificationsurl: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8453341public_in: 《Addiction》authors: ROSS HOMEL,abstract: After reading the deterrence literature, particularly the work of H. Laurence Ross, I concluded in the late 1970&#039;s that many road accidents could be prevented through the whokhearted implementation of random breath testing (RBT). RBT is a system of drink-drive law enforcement which aims to increase the perceived likelihood of apprehension through the use of mass breath testing techniques at roadblocks which are highly visible, are unpredictable in their locations and give the impression of ubiquity. As the result of public pressure, RBT was introduced in NSW in December 1982, with spectacular results. The law was intensively enforced and extensively advertised, partly due to the advocacy of researchers such as myself, but also because there was an acute political need for instant results. Since RBT is a difficult enforcement technique for police to sustain in effective form, researchers must strive to improve their understanding of what works, and remain in close contact with police, policy makers and politicians. Although this process is costly in terms of time and, possibly, academic &#039;pay-off&#039;, it is essential if the fragile understanding of deterrence principles amongst these groups is not to lead to superficially attractive, but probably ineffective techniques such as low visibility mobile RBT.citations_number: 60Citation: Alcohol: no ordinary commodity--a summary of the second edition.
