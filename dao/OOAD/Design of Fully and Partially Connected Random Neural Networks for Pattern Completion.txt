name: Design of Fully and Partially Connected Random Neural Networks for Pattern Completionurl: http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-56798-4_137public_in: International Workshop on Artificial Neural Networksauthors: Christine Hubert,abstract: In previous works [1,2,3], the behavior of a fully-connected single-layer Random Neural Network (RN) [4,5] has been illustrated in a problem of pattern completion. We applied the gradient-descent learning algorithm which has been introduced by Gelenbe [6,7] for recurrent RN networks. The recall of any training pattern from a corrupted version consists in a progressive retrieval process with adaptive threshold. We have reduced the influence of the pattern geometry on the performance by modifying the computation of the network state. The experimental results are now compared to thoses obtained with Hopfield&#039;s network. As the learning times in such a model become rapidly prohibitive, we look into the use of a single-layer network with local interactions between neurons. The connectivity influence on the convergence of the learning algorithm and on the recognition rates is particularly examined.citations_number: 8Citation: A novel model by evolving partially connected neural network for stock price trend forecasting "Pei-Chann Chang" "Di-di Wang" "Chang-le Zhou" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=65211883a97e3fc5f6aebd4e9b38384fAttractors in recurrent behavior networks "Goetz, Philip S" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=830a1bab005e9001d4e02d6f14105033Pattern completion with the random neural network using the RPROP learning algorithm "Hubert, C" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=246a14d469a4f48229bfbbf28e03c031A Neuronal Basis for the Fan Effect "Philip Goetz" "Deborah Walters" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d4961db3758acf5aa9c9807abee61990A Partially Connected Neural Evolutionary Network for Stock Price Index Forecasting "Didi Wang" "PeiChann Chang" "JhengLong Wu" "Changle Zhou" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=e3299be3542bbcd412ff623f5940f2cbA partially connected neural evolutionary network for stock price index forecasting "Didi Wang" "Pei-Chann Chang" "Jheng-Long Wu" "Changle Zhou" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=abe1684bd451b3e237f45e43227ef435A Partially Connected Neural Evolutionary Network for Stock Price Index Forecasting "Didi Wang" "PeiChann Chang" "JhengLong Wu" "Changle Zhou" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f62ca437213482e5bae762684c142256A novel model by evolving partially connected neural network for stock price trend forecasting "Pei-Chann Chang" "Di-Di Wang" "Chang-Le Zhou" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d967c4480e52723e65cfefcecfe05e92References: Theory of the random neural network "Gelenbe, Erol" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d10168839f218ff156e3f3c7c9d42c05Stability of the Random Neural Network Model "Erol Gelenbe" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8edc3ac35c76f5bb7c1ffbd42b4421a5
