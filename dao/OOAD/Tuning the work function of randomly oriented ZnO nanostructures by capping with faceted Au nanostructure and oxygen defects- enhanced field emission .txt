name: Tuning the work function of randomly oriented ZnO nanostructures by capping with faceted Au nanostructure and oxygen defects: enhanced field emission experiments and DFT studiesurl: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0957-4484/27/12/125701/metapublic_in: Nanotechnologyauthors: Ghosh, Arnab, Guha, Puspendu, Thapa, Ranjit,abstract: The lowering of the work function (Φ) can lead to a better field emission (FE) behavior at lower threshold fields. We report on enhanced FE from randomly oriented and faceted Au-capped ZnO hetero-nanostructures (HNs) having more oxygen defects. Large-area arrays of non-aligned, faceted Au-capped ZnO HNs, such as nanowires (NWs) and triangular nanoflakes (TNFs) are grown using the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Enhanced FE properties from the TNF sample resulted in a turn-on field as low as 0.52 Vμm−1at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2and a field enhancement factor (β) as high as ≈5.16 × 105. Under similar experimental conditions, drawing the same current density from an NW specimen needs a higher turn-on field (0.86 Vμm−1) and to exhibit nearly four times less field enhancement factor compared to the TNFs samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and photoluminescence (PL) measurements confirm the presence of more oxygen defects in the TNF samples compared to the NW samples. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements show the average local work function to be 4.70 ± 0.1 eV for the TNF sample, which is ≈ 0.34 eV lower than the NW sample. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the estimated Φ values are found to be 4.98 eV for ZnO(0001), 4.17 eV for Au(001)/ZnO(0001) and 3.91 eV for Au(001)/Ovac-ZnO(0001) surfaces. The DFT results are qualitatively in agreement with our experimental results. The presence of Au nanostructures on top of O-deficient and sharp-tipped TNFs results in enhanced FE performance following their reduced tunneling barrier via pinning of effective Φ.citations_number: 1Citation: Role of work function in field emission enhancement of Au island decorated vertically aligned ZnO nanotapers "Avanendra Singh" "Kartik Senapatil" "Mohit Kumar" "Tapobrata Som" "Anil K.
