name: A random-effects logit model of work-welfare transitionsurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304407690901075public_in: 《Journal of Econometrics》authors: Enberg, John,Gottschalk, Peter,Wolf, Douglas,abstract: This paper models the transitions between states defined in terms of work and welfare status as a discrete-time competing-risk model with unobserved heterogeneity. A random-effects logit model is estimated with a panel drawn from Wisconsin administrative records. Unobservables are assumed to follow a discrete distribution. The most striking result is that welfare recipients were substantially less likely to start working while remaining on welfare afterthe 1981 changes in program rules.citations_number: 35Citation: Mixed MNL models for discrete response "Daniel McFadden" "Kenneth Train" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8ec8f38475fd3b78590c2ed491ffe9d5Chapter 55–Duration Models: Specification, Identification and Multiple Durations ☆ "Gerard J.
