name: Exploiting peak device throughput from random access workloadurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/262288265_Exploiting_peak_device_throughput_from_random_access_workloadpublic_in: Usenix Conference on Hot Topics in Storage &amp; File Systemsauthors: Young Jin Yu,Dong In Shin,Woong Shin,abstract: ABSTRACT  In this work, we propose a new batching scheme called temporal merge, which dispatches discontiguous block requests using a single I/O operation. It overcomes the disadvantages of narrow block interface and enables an OS to exploit peak throughput of a storage device for small random requests as well as a single large request. Temporal merge significantly enhances device and channel utilization regardless of access sequentiality of a workload, which has not been achievable by traditional schemes. We extended the block I/O interface of a DRAM-based SSD in cooperation with its vendor, and implemented temporal merge into I/O subsystem in Linux 2.6.32. The experimental results show that under multi-threaded random access workload, the proposed solution can achieve 87%-100% of peak throughput of the SSD. We expect that the new temporal merge interface will lead to better design of future host controller interfaces such as NVMHCI for next-generation storage devices.citations_number: 10Citation: Optimizing the Block I\/O Subsystem for Fast Storage Devices "Young Jin Yu" "Dong In Shin" "Woong Shin" "Nae Young Song" "Jae Woo Choi" "Hyeong Seog Kim" "Hyeonsang Eom" "Heon Young Yeom" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b8892bb6696741cc33032f2cd9647e77Design and evaluation of a user-level file system for fast storage devices "Yongseok Son" "Nae Young Song" "Hyuck Han" "Hyeonsang Eom" "Heon Young Yeom" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=80b3287209ef0d158be4bb106b9c057bTowards High-Performance SAN with Fast Storage Devices "Jae Woo Choi" "Dong In Shin" "Young Jin Yu" "Hyeonsang Eom" "Heon Young Yeom" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=408bb686ae0b8e80e6973d27bfbe4faeEnhancing the I\/O system for virtual machines using high performance SSDs "Myoungwon Oh" "Hyeonsang Eom" "Heon Y.
