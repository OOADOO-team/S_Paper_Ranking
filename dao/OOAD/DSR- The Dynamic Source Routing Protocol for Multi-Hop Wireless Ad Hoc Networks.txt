name: DSR: The Dynamic Source Routing Protocol for Multi-Hop Wireless Ad Hoc Networksurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2400396_DSR_The_Dynamic_Source_Routing_Protocol_for_Multi-Hop_Wireless_Ad_Hoc_Networkspublic_in: Noneauthors: David B. Johnson,David A. Maltz,Josh Broch,abstract: Abstract The Dynamic Source Routing protocol (DSR) is a simple and efficient routing protocol designed specifically for use in multi-hop wireless ad hoc networks of mobile nodes. DSR allows the network to be completely self-organizing and self-configuring, without the need for any existing network infrastructure or administration. The protocol is composed of the two mechanisms of Route Discovery and Route Maintenance, which work together to allow nodes to discover and maintain source routes to arbitrary destinations in the ad hoc network. The use of source routing allows packet routing to be trivially loop-free, avoids the need for up-to-date routing information in the intermediate nodes through which packets are forwarded, and allows nodes forwarding or overhearing packets to cache the routing information in them for their own future use. All aspects of the protocol operate entirely on-demand, allowing the routing packet overhead of DSR to scale automatically to only that needed to react to changes in the routes currently in use.citations_number: 2891Citation: Performance analysis of the CONFIDANT protocol.
