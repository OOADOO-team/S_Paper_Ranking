name: Spray and wait: an efficient routing scheme for intermittently connected mobile networksurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/228341217public_in: Acm Sigcomm Workshop on Delay-tolerant Networkingauthors: Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos,Konstantinos Psounis,Cauligi S. Raghavendra,abstract: Intermittently connected mobile networks are sparse wireless networks where most of the time there does not exist a complete path from the source to the destination. These networks fall into the general category of Delay Tolerant Networks. There are many real networks that follow this paradigm, for example, wildlife tracking sensor networks, military networks, inter-planetary networks, etc. In this context, conventional routing schemes would fail.To deal with such networks researchers have suggested to use flooding-based routing schemes. While flooding-based schemes have a high probability of delivery, they waste a lot of energy and suffer from severe contention, which can significantly degrade their performance. Furthermore, proposed efforts to significantly reduce the overhead of flooding-based schemes have often be plagued by large delays. With this in mind, we introduce a new routing scheme, called Spray and Wait, that &quot;sprays&quot; a number of copies into the network, and then &quot;waits&quot; till one of these nodes meets the destination.Using theory and simulations we show that Spray and Wait outperforms all existing schemes with respect to both average message delivery delay and number of transmissions per message delivered; its overall performance is close to the optimal scheme. Furthermore, it is highly scalable retaining good performance under a large range of scenarios, unlike other schemes. Finally, it is simple to implement and to optimize in order to achieve given performance goals in practice.citations_number: 2654Citation: BUBBLE Rap: Social-Based Forwarding in Delay-Tolerant Networks "Pan Hui" "Jon Crowcroft" "Eiko Yoneki" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9a99ec927214fc9849beed304923567eDTN routing as a resource allocation problem "Aruna Balasubramanian" "Brian Levine" "Arun Venkataramani" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=295b5cf11d79d0391e8cefefbf4ed091Spray and Focus: Efficient Mobility-Assisted Routing for Heterogeneous and Correlated Mobility "Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos" "Konstantinos Psounis" "Cauligi S.
