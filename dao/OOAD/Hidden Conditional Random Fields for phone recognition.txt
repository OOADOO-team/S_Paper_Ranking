name: Hidden Conditional Random Fields for phone recognitionurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/224096951_Hidden_Conditional_Random_Fields_for_phone_recognitionpublic_in: IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition &amp; Understandingauthors: Yun-Hsuan Sung,Dan Jurafsky,abstract: We apply Hidden Conditional Random Fields (HCRFs) to the task of TIMIT phone recognition. HCRFs are discriminatively trained sequence models that augment conditional random fields with hidden states that are capable of representing subphones and mixture components. We extend HCRFs, which had previously only been applied to phone classification with known boundaries, to recognize continuous phone sequences. We use an N-best inference algorithm in both learning (to approximate all competitor phone sequences) and decoding (to marginalize over hidden states). Our monophone HCRFs achieve 28.3% phone error rate, outperforming maximum likelihood trained HMMs by 3.6%, maximum mutual information trained HMMs by 2.5%, and minimum phone error trained HMMs by 2.2%. We show that this win is partially due to HCRFs&#039; ability to simultaneously optimize discriminative language models and acoustic models, a powerful property that has important implications for speech recognition.citations_number: 45Citation: Coarse-to-fine natural language processing "Petrov, Slav Orlinov" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=575d76c119763d293be16bb8fc45b2c2Letter-to-Sound Pronunciation Prediction Using Conditional Random Fields "Dong Wang" "Simon King" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=5ac89c349dcb3f530d5cbfef8b8f0fbaPAC-Bayesian approach for minimization of phoneme error rate "Keshet, J" "McAllester, D" "Hazan, T" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9ebcb3fd2c5e12d8b5da9e6abf12f9ddPAC-Bayesian approach for minimization of phoneme error rate "Joseph Keshet" "David McAllester" "Tamir Hazan" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=57c733224d438cc0b5aeb663b74036cdStructured Discriminative Models For Speech Recognition: An Overview "Gales, Mark" "Watanabe, Shinji" "Fosler-Lussier, Eric" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c28a7760bb498cf6686bfe92d00e2812Conditional Random Fields in Speech, Audio, and Language Processing "Eric Fosler-Lussier" "Yanzhang He" "Preethi Jyothi" "Rohit Prabhavalkar" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=61dd9092072dd93a5487aa7bd93e0189Subword Modeling for Automatic Speech Recognition: Past, Present, and Emerging Approaches "Karen Livescu" "Eric Fosler-Lussier" "Florian Metze" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=32f8fd805f2e28925ae4a3b017f379bdSequential Deep Belief Networks "Galen Andrew" "Jeff Bilmes" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=890dc7fc2313a8923672bc122bdb382cElectrical Engineering and Computer Science.
