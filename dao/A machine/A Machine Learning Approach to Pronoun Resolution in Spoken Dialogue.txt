name: A Machine Learning Approach to Pronoun Resolution in Spoken Dialogueurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2923396_A_Machine_Learning_Approach_to_Pronoun_Resolution_in_Spoken_Dialoguepublic_in: Meeting on Association for Computational Linguisticsauthors: Michael Strube,Christoph Müller,abstract: ABSTRACT  We apply a decision tree based approach to pronoun resolution in spoken dialogue. Our system deals with pronouns with NP-and non-NP-antecedents. We present a set of features designed for pronoun resolution in spoken dialogue and determine the most promising features. We evaluate the system on twenty Switchboard dialogues and show that it compares well to Byron&#039;s (2002) manually tuned system.citations_number: 107Citation: Machine Learning for Coreference Resolution: From Local Classification to Global Ranking.
