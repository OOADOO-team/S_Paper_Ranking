name: A machine learning approach to building domain-specific search enginesurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2950591_Building_Domain-Specific_Search_Engines_withpublic_in: Proceedings of the 16th international joint conference on Artificial intelligence - Volume 2authors: McCallum, Andrew,Nigam, Kamal,Rennie, Jason,abstract: ABSTRACT Domain-specic search engines are becoming increasingly popular because they oer increased accuracy and extra features not possible with general, Web-wide search engines. Unfortunately, they are also dicult and timeconsuming to maintain. This paper proposes the use of machine learning techniques to greatly automate the creation and maintenance of domain-specic search engines. We describe new research in reinforcement learning, text classication and information extraction that enables ecient spidering, populates topic hierarchies, and identies informative text segments. Using these techniques, we have built a demonstration system: a search engine for computer science research papers available at www.cora.justresearch.com. 1 Introduction As the amount of information on the World Wide Web grows, it becomes increasingly dicult to nd just what we want. While general-purpose search engines such as Altavista and HotBot oer high coverage, they often provide only low pre...citations_number: 299Citation: Web data mining: exploring hyperlinks, contents, and usage data.
