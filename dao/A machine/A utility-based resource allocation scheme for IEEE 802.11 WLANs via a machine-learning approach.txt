name: A utility-based resource allocation scheme for IEEE 802.11 WLANs via a machine-learning approachurl: http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11276-014-0708-zpublic_in: 《Wireless Networks》authors: Chiapin Wang,Wen-Hsing Kuo,abstract: The problem of allocating resources in IEEE 802.11 wireless local area networks (WLAN) is challenging due to limited bandwidth, time-varying channel conditions, and especially the distributed channel-access manner. In this paper we propose an intelligent resource allocation scheme that dynamically adjusts medium-access-control (MAC) parameters to tune channel-access opportunities and maximize the total utility. “Intelligent” refers to the capability of our approach to regulate each 802.11 node’s parameters automatically according to the changes of surrounding situations, e.g. channel conditions and number of nodes. Our intelligent allocation scheme uses neural networks to on-line learn the nonlinear function between the adopted MAC parameters and allocated throughput. Based on the learned knowledge, MAC parameters can therefore be dynamically adjusted toward the desired throughput allocation and consequently the maximal WLAN utility. Simulations results demonstrate the effectiveness of our allocation scheme in maximizing the system utility in a varying 802.11 WLAN environment.citations_number: 4Citation: User-Centric View of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Transmission Against Smart Attacks "Liang Xiao" "Caixia Xie" "Minghui Min" "Weihua Zhuang" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b3c03c6f265a23027fbba70f19603017Dynamic channel assignment algorithms for supporting QoS based services in wireless cellular environments "Papazoglou, P.M" "Karras, D.A" "Papademetriou, R.C" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ae7281e03fd2da69d8f7a0dafaf5c5c7References: Wireless communications:principles and practice "TheodoreS.Rappaport" "拉帕波特" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c775891d56dbbcb100610aac5dd602ebOn the approximate realization of continuous mappings by neural networks.
