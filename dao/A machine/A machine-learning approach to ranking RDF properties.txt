name: A machine-learning approach to ranking RDF propertiesurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/276443568_A_machine-learning_approach_to_ranking_RDF_propertiespublic_in: Noneauthors: Andrea Dessi,Maurizio Atzori,abstract: In this paper we address the problem of providing an order of relevance, or ranking , among entities’ properties used in RDF datasets, Linked Data and SPARQL endpoints. We first motivate the importance of ranking RDF properties by providing two killer applications for the problem, namely property tagging and entity visualization. Moved by the desiderata of these applications, we propose to apply Machine Learning to Rank (MLR) techniques to the problem of ranking RDF properties. Our devised solution is based on a deep empirical study of all the dimensions involved: feature selection, MLR algorithm and Model training. The major advantages of our approach are the following: (a) flexibility/personalization , as the properties’ relevance can be user-specified by personalizing the training set in a supervised approach, or set by a novel automatic classification approach based on SWiPE; (b) speed , since it can be applied without computing frequencies over the whole dataset, leveraging existing fast MLR algorithms; (c) effectiveness , as it can be applied even when no ontology data is available by using novel dataset-independent features; (d) precision , which is high both in terms of f-measure and Spearman’s rho. Experimental results show that the proposed MLR framework outperform the two existing approaches found in literature which are related to RDF property ranking.citations_number: 11Citation: Dynamic Factual Summaries for Entity Cards "Hasibi, Faegheh" "Balog, Krisztian" "Bratsberg, Svein Erik" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=4f2f7437d69c7a6c8e7058bbf9bf13a6Assessing the Completeness of Entities in Knowledge Bases "Albin Ahmeti" "Simon Razniewski" "Axel Polleres" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=51ccededab4d3220b8bf02153147b059Holistic and scalable ranking of RDF data "Axel-Cyrille" "Ngonga Ngomo" "Michael Hoffmann" "Ricardo Usbeck" "Kunal Jha" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a17a4b77180b0fb45f68da335ee30698Doctoral Advisor or Medical Condition: Towards Entity-Specific Rankings of Knowledge Base Properties "Simon Razniewski" "Vevake Balaraman" "Werner Nutt" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cfb352498a78f894c3413257680a39daMultiple Models for Recommending Temporal Aspects of Entities "Tu Ngoc Nguyen" "Nattiya Kanhabua" "Wolfgang Nejdl" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ea1b8b87235b6b20712998fe0f7d8b79Doctoral Advisor or Medical Condition: Towards Entity-Specific Rankings of Knowledge Base Properties "Simon Razniewski" "Vevake Balaraman" "Werner Nutt" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1c21e21cd2ee8330c6bbf64d013fdf8aMultiple Models for Recommending Temporal Aspects of Entities "Tu Ngoc Nguyen" "Nattiya Kanhabua" "Wolfgang Nejdl" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c2d960dc0cd4a6b46305dfb73d7d0a33Assessing the Completeness of Entities in Knowledge Bases "Albin Ahmeti" "Simon Razniewski" "Axel Polleres" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=a379e5cc1d438dc06923b806a973f868References: DBpedia spotlight:shedding light on the web of documents "Pablo N.
