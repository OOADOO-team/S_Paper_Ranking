name: A Machine Learning Approach to Coreference Resolution of Noun Phrasesurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2527394_A_Machine_Learning_Approach_to_Coreference_Resolution_of_Noun_Phrases?ev=prf_citpublic_in: Noneauthors: Wee Meng Soon,Daniel Chung,Daniel Chung Yong Lim,abstract: In this paper, we present a learning approach to coreference resolution of noun phrases in unrestricted text. The approach learns from a small, annotated corpus and the task includes resolving not just a certain type of noun phrase (e.g., pronouns) but rather general noun phrases. It also does not restrict the entity types of the noun phrases; that is, coreference is assigned whether they are of “organization,”“person,” or other types. We evaluate our approach on common data sets (namely, the MUC-6 and MUC-7 coreference corpora) and obtain encouraging results, indicating that on the general noun phrase coreference task, the learning approach holds promise and achieves accuracy comparable to that of nonlearning approaches. Our system is the first learning-based system that offers performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art nonlearning systems on these data sets.citations_number: 1083Citation: WikiRelate! computing semantic relatedness using wikipedia "Strube, Michael" "Ponzetto, Simone Paolo" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=35bed96fc5c5513ed17cdfd4b9c9f014WikiRelate! computing semantic relatedness using wikipedia "Strube" "Michael" "Ponzetto" "Simone Paolo" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=16d0660ff468e0a8c5357503f3a87bb6Improving machine learning approaches to coreference resolution "Vincent Ng" "Claire Cardie" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=be19bcf8ab49c25636c2fc8966bf6b4fModeling local coherence: an entity-based approach "Regina Barzilay" "Mirella Lapata" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=52cb15a4e0e1c16577c20067a2a7e89dBLOG: probabilistic models with unknown objects "Brian Milch" "Bhaskara Marthi" "Stuart Russell" "David Sontag" "Daniel L.
