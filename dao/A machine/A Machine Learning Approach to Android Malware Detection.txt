name: A Machine Learning Approach to Android Malware Detectionurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/261427835_A_Machine_Learning_Approach_to_Android_Malware_Detectionpublic_in: Intelligence &amp; Security Informatics Conferenceauthors: Justin Sahs,Latifur Khan,abstract: With the recent emergence of mobile platforms capable of executing increasingly complex software and the rising ubiquity of using mobile platforms in sensitive applications such as banking, there is a rising danger associated with malware targeted at mobile devices. The problem of detecting such malware presents unique challenges due to the limited resources avalible and limited privileges granted to the user, but also presents unique opportunity in the required metadata attached to each application. In this article, we present a machine learning-based system for the detection of malware on Android devices. Our system extracts a number of features and trains a One-Class Support Vector Machine in an offline (off-device) manner, in order to leverage the higher computing power of a server or cluster of servers.citations_number: 104Citation: A New Android Malware Detection Approach Using Bayesian Classification "Suleiman Y.
