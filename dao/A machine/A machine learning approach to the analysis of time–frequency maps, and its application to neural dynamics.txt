name: A machine learning approach to the analysis of time–frequency maps, and its application to neural dynamicsurl: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608006002309public_in: 《Neural Networks》authors: abstract: The statistical analysis of experimentally recorded brain activity patterns may require comparisons between large sets of complex signals in order to find meaningful similarities and differences between signals with large variability. High-level representations such as time–frequency maps convey a wealth of useful information, but they involve a large number of parameters that make statistical investigations of many signals difficult at present. In this paper, we describe a method that performs drastic reduction in the complexity of time–frequency representations through a modelling of the maps by elementary functions. The method is validated on artificial signals and subsequently applied to electrophysiological brain signals (local field potential) recorded from the olfactory bulb of rats while they are trained to recognize odours. From hundreds of experimental recordings, reproducible time–frequency events are detected, and relevant features are extracted, which allow further information processing, such as automatic classification.citations_number: 57Citation: A comparative study of synchrony measures for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease based on EEG.
