name: A Machine Learning Approach to Software Requirements Prioritizationurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/260649019_A_Machine_Learning_Approach_to_Software_Requirements_Prioritizationpublic_in: IEEE Transactions on Software Engineeringauthors: Perini, Anna, Susi, Angelo, Avesani, Paolo,abstract: Deciding which, among a set of requirements, are to be considered first and in which order is a strategic process in software development. This task is commonly referred to as requirements prioritization. This paper describes a requirements prioritization method called Case-Based Ranking (CBRank), which combines project&#039;s stakeholders preferences with requirements ordering approximations computed through machine learning techniques, bringing promising advantages. First, the human effort to input preference information can be reduced, while preserving the accuracy of the final ranking estimates. Second, domain knowledge encoded as partial order relations defined over the requirement attributes can be exploited, thus supporting an adaptive elicitation process. The techniques CBRank rests on and the associated prioritization process are detailed. Empirical evaluations of properties of CBRank are performed on simulated data and compared with a state-of-the-art prioritization method, providing evidence of the method ability to support the management of the tradeoff between elicitation effort and ranking accuracy and to exploit domain knowledge. A case study on a real software project complements these experimental measurements. Finally, a positioning of CBRank with respect to state-of-the-art requirements prioritization methods is proposed, together with a discussion of benefits and limits of the method.citations_number: 59Citation: A systematic literature review of software requirements prioritization research "Philip Achimugu" "Ali Selamat" "Roliana Ibrahim" "Mohd Naz'ri Mahrin" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=157dba3b2dc2a722d5c1910d5a584b92Requirements prioritization in software engineering: A systematic mapping study "Massimiliano Pergher" "Bruno Rossi" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=75dac744844a5ed4627e9235df83c0b5An Approach for Integrating the Prioritization of Functional and Nonfunctional Requirements "Mohammad Dabbagh" "Sai Peck Lee" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=87748bf9cb353cef6d4fe4be6fa24a62Choosing compliance solutions through stakeholder preferences "Silvia Ingolfo" "Alberto Siena" "Ivan Jureta" "Angelo Susi" "Anna Perini" "John Mylopoulos" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8946844307d37165009d9271b7f6853dChoosing Compliance Solutions through Stakeholder Preferences "Silvia Ingolfo" "Alberto Siena" "Ivan Jureta" "Angelo Susi" "Anna Perini" "John Mylopoulos" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=afae28af48d0619e8843a1eb062cfaf4Requirements prioritization techniques and different aspects for prioritization a systematic literature review protocol "Falak Sher" "Dayang N.
