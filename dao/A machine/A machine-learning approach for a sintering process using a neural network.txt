name: A machine-learning approach for a sintering process using a neural networkurl: http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/095372899232551public_in: Production Planning &amp; Controlauthors: Shigaki, Ichiro, Narazaki, Hiroshi,abstract: This paper presents a machine-learning approach using a multi-layered neural network (NN) with application to a sintering process in an iron- and steer-making plant. Our method induces &#039;operational rules&#039; that determine operational conditions to obtain products that meet a given quality specification. In our application, an operational condition decides the appropriate ranges of chemical composition and heat input to obtain sinter with desirable properties. Our approach consists of two stages. First, backpropagation (BP) training is performed to obtain a NN which decides whether a given condition is appropriate or not. Secondly, from the trained NN, we extract rules which explain what operational conditions are appropriate. In spite of the effective learning capability, a major drawback of a NN is &#039;unreadability&#039; of the learned knowledge, or the lack of an explanatory capability, which is crucial in the second stage. We developed a rule extraction algorithm which contributes to overcoming this &#039;unreadability&#039;. The extracted rules are found to agree well with the knowledge in material science.citations_number: 28Citation: Computational intelligence for engineering and manufacturing "Andina, Diego" "Pham, D.
