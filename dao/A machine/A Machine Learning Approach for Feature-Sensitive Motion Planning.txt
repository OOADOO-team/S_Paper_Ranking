name: A Machine Learning Approach for Feature-Sensitive Motion Planningurl: http://link.springer.com/10.1007/10991541_25public_in: Noneauthors: Marco Morales,Lydia Tapia,Roger Pearce,abstract: Although there are many motion planning techniques, there is no method that outperforms all others for all problem instances. Rather, each technique has different strengths and weaknesses which makes it best-suited for certain types of problems. Moreover, since an environment can contain vastly different regions, there may not be a single planner that will perform well in all its regions. Ideally, one would use a suite of planners in concert and would solve the problem by applying the best-suited planner in each region. In this paper, we propose an automated framework for feature-sensitive motion planning. We use a machine learning approach to characterize and partition C-space into regions that are well suited to one of the methods in our library of roadmap-based motion planners. After the best-suited method is applied in each region, the resulting region roadmaps are combined to form a roadmap of the entire planning space. Over a range of problems, we demonstrate that our simple prototype system reliably outperforms any of the planners on their own.citations_number: 112Citation: On the Probabilistic Foundations of Probabilistic Roadmap Planning "David Hsu" "Jean-Claude Latombe" "Hanna Kurniawati" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=77a461d1f349c5c22543849bda664792On the Probabilistic Foundations of Probabilistic Roadmap Planning "David Hsu" "Jean-Claude Latombe" "Hanna Kurniawati" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=fcf2bf3bac94f76423896e88fd2baaffAn obstacle-based rapidly-exploring random tree "Rodriguez" "Xinyu Tang" "Jyh-Ming Lien" "N.
