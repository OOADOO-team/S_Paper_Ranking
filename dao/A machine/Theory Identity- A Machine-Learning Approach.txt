name: Theory Identity: A Machine-Learning Approachurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/256438214_Theory_Identity_A_Machine-Learning_Approachpublic_in: Hawaii International Conference on System Sciencesauthors: Larsen, K.R,Hovorka, D,West, J,abstract: Theory identity is a fundamental problem for researchers seeking to determine theory quality, create theory ontologies and taxonomies, or perform focused theory-specific reviews and meta-analyses. We demonstrate a novel machine-learning approach to theory identification based on citation data and article features. The multi-disciplinary ecosystem of articles which cite a theory&#039;s originating paper is created and refined into the network of papers predicted to contribute to, and thus identify, a specific theory. We provide a &#039;proof-of-concept&#039; for a highly-cited theory. Implications for cross-disciplinary theory integration and the identification of theories for a rapidly expanding scientific literature are discussed.citations_number: 5Citation: A recommendation system based on hierarchical clustering of an article-level citation network "Jevin D.
