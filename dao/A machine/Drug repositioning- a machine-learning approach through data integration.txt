name: Drug repositioning: a machine-learning approach through data integrationurl: http://med.wanfangdata.com.cn/Paper/Detail/PeriodicalPaper_PM23800010public_in: 《Journal of Cheminformatics》authors: Francesco Napolitano,Yan Zhao,Moreira, Vânia M,abstract: Existing computational methods for drug repositioning either rely only on the gene expression response of cell lines after treatment, or on drug-to-disease relationships, merging several information levels. However, the noisy nature of the gene expression and the scarcity of genomic data for many diseases are important limitations to such approaches. Here we focused on a drug-centered approach by predicting the therapeutic class of FDA-approved compounds, not considering data concerning the diseases. We propose a novel computational approach to predict drug repositioning based on state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms. We have integrated multiple layers of information: i) on the distances of the drugs based on how similar are their chemical structures, ii) on how close are their targets within the protein-protein interaction network, and iii) on how correlated are the gene expression patterns after treatment. Our classifier reaches high accuracy levels (78%), allowing us to re-interpret the top misclassifications as re-classifications, after rigorous statistical evaluation. Efficient drug repurposing has the potential to significantly impact the whole field of drug development. The results presented here can significantly accelerate the translation into the clinics of known compounds for novel therapeutic uses.citations_number: 46Citation: A survey of current trends in computational drug repositioning "Li J" "Zheng S" "Chen B" "Butte AJ" "Swamidass SJ" "Lu Z" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f861b6b611a4124d1d171711d3e28352Machine learning methods in chemoinformatics "JB Mitchell" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=f301ae51959858ef196552e0ba309b7dOpportunities and obstacles for deep learning in biology and medicine "Ching T" "Himmelstein DS" "Beaulieu-Jones BK" "Kalinin AA" "Do BT" "Way GP" "Ferrero E" "Agapow PM" "Zietz M" "Hoffman MM" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=301b7b90348722d98f1b26ba41dffb04Methods for biological data integration: perspectives and challenges.
