name: A Machine Learning Approach to Answering Questions for Reading Comprehension Testsurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2557383_A_Machine_Learning_Approach_to_Answering_Questions_for_Reading_Comprehension_Testspublic_in: Joint Sigdat Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing &amp; Very Large Corpora: Held in Conjunction with the Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguisticsauthors: Hwee Tou Ng,Leong Hwee Teo,Jennifer Lai,abstract: Abstract In this paper, we report results on answering questions for the reading comprehension task, using a machine learning approach. We evaluated our approach on the Remedia data set, a common data set used in several recent papers on the reading comprehension task. Our learning approach achieves accuracy competitive to previous approaches that rely on handcrafted, deterministic rules and algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that reports that the use of a machine learning approach achieves competitive results on answering questions for reading comprehension tests.citations_number: 68Citation: Analyses for elucidating current question answering technology "Marc Light" "Gideon S.
