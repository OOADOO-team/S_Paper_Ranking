name: Creating and Using Models for Engineering Design: A Machine-Learning Approachurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/220628164_Creating_and_Using_Models_for_Engineering_Design_A_Machine-Learning_Approachpublic_in: 《IEEE Expert Intelligent Systems &amp; Their Applications》authors: Sudhakar Yerramareddy,David K. Tcheng,Stephen C. Y. Lu,abstract: An adaptive and interactive modeling system (AIMS) that integrates simulation, optimization and machine learning to help engineers make design decisions is described. AIMS views engineering decision making as a two-phase process of creating and then using models. The competitive relation learner and the induce-and-select optimizer, AIMS&#039;s two main components, and their roles in both phases of decision-making are discussed. AIMS&#039;s role in supporting the design of a diesel engine that outputs power within the 440- to 460-kW range and consumes the least amount of fuel is also discussed.&lt;citations_number: 23Citation: Metamodels for Computer-based Engineering Design: Survey and recommendations "T.W.
