name: A Machine Learning Approach to TCP Throughput Predictionurl: http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1269899.1254894public_in: Acm Sigmetrics International Conference on Measurement &amp; Modeling of Computer Systemsauthors: Mirza, Mariyam,Sommers, Joel,Barford, Paul,abstract: TCP throughput prediction is an important capability in wide area overlay and multi-homed networks where multiple paths may exist between data sources and receivers. In this paper we describe a new, lightweight method for TCP throughput prediction that can generate accurate forecasts for a broad range of file sizes and path conditions. Our method is based on Support Vector Regression modeling that uses a combination of prior file transfers and measurements of simple path properties. We calibrate and evaluate the capabilities of our throughput predictor in an extensive set of lab-based experiments where ground truth can be established for path properties using highly accurate passive measurements. We report the performance for our method in the ideal case of using our passive path property measurements over a range of test configurations. Our results show that for bulk transfers in heavy traffic, TCP throughput is predicted within 10% of the actual value 87% of the time, representing nearly a 3-fold improvement in accuracy over prior history-based methods. In the same lab environment, we assess our method using less accurate active probe measurements of path properties, and show that predictions can be made within 10% of the actual value nearly 50% of the time over a range of file sizes and traffic conditions. This result represents approximately a 60% improvement over history-based methods with a much lower impact on end-to-end paths. Finally, we implement our predictor in a tool called PathPerf and test it in experiments conducted on wide area paths. The results demonstrate that PathPerf predicts TCP through put accurately over a variety of paths.citations_number: 135Citation: Towards agile and smooth video adaptation in dynamic HTTP streaming "Guibin Tian" "Yong Liu" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=ad3b9ade1236713a566d5f70279f4982Answering what-if deployment and configuration questions with wise "Mukarram Tariq" "Amgad Zeitoun" "Vytautas Valancius" "Nick Feamster" "Mostafa Ammar" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=aacf5bf7fe23845619ac4796fdc6f958Support vector regression for link load prediction "Paola Bermolen" "Dario Rossi" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=dcf1338f53914cd8c21cc87914350897Support vector regression for link load prediction "Bermolen, P" "Rossi, D" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=61b7915fe6ddd271655f21ca20edac90Answering \"What-If\" Deployment and Configuration Questions With WISE: Techniques and Deployment Experience "Mukarram Bin Tariq" "Kaushik Bhandankar" "Member" "IEEE" "Vytautas Valancius" "Member" "IEEE" "Amgad Zeitoun" "Member" "IEEE" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=62698e0d6cc7c17618e68abc5a7531c6Online Anomaly Prediction for Robust Cluster Systems "Xiaohui Gu" "Haixun Wang" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7d6f3550b2b377a2beb63ee4c1872e21Practical power modeling of data transmission over 802.11g for wireless applications "Yu Xiao" "Petri Savolainen" "Arto Karppanen" "Matti Siekkinen" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=245962c8688e4418358d1d6879f556fdOnline Anomaly Prediction for Robust Cluster Systems "Xiaohui Gu" "Haixun Wang" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=3f76c52474f14ab8a6edc315bb760fdbPolyCert: Polymorphic Self-optimizing Replication for In-Memory Transactional Grids.
