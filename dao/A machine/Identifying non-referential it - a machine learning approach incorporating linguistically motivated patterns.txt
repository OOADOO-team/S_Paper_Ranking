name: Identifying non-referential it : a machine learning approach incorporating linguistically motivated patternsurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/234829061_Identifying_non-referential_it__a_machine_learning_approach_incorporating_linguistically_motivated_patternspublic_in: Acl Workshop on Feature Engineering for Machine Learning in Natural Language Processingauthors: Adriane Boyd,Whitney Gegg-Harrison,Donna Byron,abstract: ABSTRACT  In this paper, we present a machine learning system for identifying non-referential it. Types of non-referential it are examined to determine relevant linguistic patterns. The patterns are incorporated as features in a machine learning system which performs a binary classification of it as referential or non-referential in a POS-tagged corpus. The selection of relevant, generalized patterns leads to a significant improvement in performance.citations_number: 60Citation: Deterministic coreference resolution based on entity-centric, precision-ranked rules "Heeyoung Lee" "Angel Chang" "Yves Peirsman" "Nathanael Chambers" "Mihai Surdeanu" "Dan Jurafsky" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=1a3ddc86a0c2c6710d481555144de46bCoreference systems based on kernels methods "Yannick Versley" "Alessandro Moschitti" "Xiaofeng Yang" "Xiaofeng Yang" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cac893d59d162e617ffd1588999e4ff5Data-driven multilingual coreference resolution using resolver stacking "Anders Björkelund" "Richárd Farkas" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=c5737240a8fbae0de0897396c8a57790NADA: A Robust System for Non-referential Pronoun Detection "Shane Bergsma" "David Yarowsky" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=feb1edc35a1a2998f9d4bcfa88fdb120NADA: A Robust System for Non-referential Pronoun Detection "Shane Bergsma" "David Yarowsky" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=9efaafcb3f7223948d664a412d6cede1Identification of Pleonastic It Using the Web.
