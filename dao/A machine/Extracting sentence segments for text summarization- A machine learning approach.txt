name: Extracting sentence segments for text summarization: A machine learning approachurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221299428_Extracting_sentence_segments_for_text_summarization_A_machine_learning_approach?ev=prf_highpublic_in: the 23rd annual international ACM SIGIR conferenceauthors: Wesley T. Chuang,Jihoon Yang,abstract: With the proliferation of the Internet and the huge amount of data it transfers, text summarization is becoming more important. We present an approach to the design of an automatic text summarizer that generates a summary by extracting sentence segments. First, sentences are broken into segments by special cue markers. Each segment is represented by a set of predefined features (e.g. location of the segment, average term frequencies of the words occurring in the segment, number of title words in the segment, and the like). Then a supervised learning algorithm is used to train the summarizer to extract important sentence segments, based on the feature vector. Results of experiments on U.S. patents indicate that the performance of the proposed approach compares very favorably with other approaches (including Microsoft Word summarizer) in terms of precision, recall, and classification accuracy.citations_number: 188Citation: Generic summarization and keyphrase extraction using mutual reinforcement principle and sentence clustering "Hongyuan Zha" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=7c0c274d82ae175df0a45134a1745dd0Web-page classification through summarization "Dou Shen" "Zheng Chen" "Qiang Yang" "Hua-Jun Zeng" "Benyu Zhang" "Yuchang Lu" "Wei-Ying Ma" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=2315c79d4967c01f5c97b0ba7955b395Automatic generic document summarization based on non-negative matrix factorization "Ju-Hong Lee" "Sun Park" "Chan-Min Ahn" "Daeho Kim" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8b1fa0794a211522da932c12b7fbd7f5Web-page summarization using clickthrough data "Jian-Tao Sun" "Dou Shen" "Hua-Jun Zeng" "Qiang Yang" "Yuchang Lu" "Zheng Chen" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6299f65f84c4e9c074d01943776b3819The use of unlabeled data to improve supervised learning for text summarization "Massih-Reza Amini" "Patrick Gallinari" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=47c69943e12908a3f2cc4a37711aee53\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u6587\u672c\u81ea\u52a8\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528 "张奇" "黄萱菁" "吴立德" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=be5d67cfcc761b5b8336ef7684b08975Automatic Text Summarization Based On Word Clusters And Ranking Algorithms "Massih R.
