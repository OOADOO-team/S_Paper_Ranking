name: A machine learning approach to multilingual and cross-lingual ontology matchingurl: http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-642-25073-6_42public_in: Noneauthors: Spohr, Dennis,Hollink, Laura,Cimiano, Philipp,abstract: Ontology matching is a task that has attracted considerable attention in recent years. With very few exceptions, however, research in ontology matching has focused primarily on the development of monolingual matching algorithms. As more and more resources become available in more than one language, novel algorithms are required which are capable of matching ontologies which share more than one language, or ontologies which are multilingual but do not share any languages. In this paper, we discuss several approaches to learning a matching function between two ontologies using a small set of manually aligned concepts, and evaluate them on different pairs of financial accounting standards, showing that multilingual information can indeed improve the matching quality, even in cross-lingual scenarios. In addition to this, as current research on ontology matching does not make a satisfactory distinction between multilingual and cross-lingual ontology matching, we provide precise definitions of these terms in relation to monolingual ontology matching, and quantify their effects on different matching algorithms.citations_number: 63Citation: Ontology Matching: State of the Art and Future Challenges "P.
