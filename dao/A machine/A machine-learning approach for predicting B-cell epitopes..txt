name: A machine-learning approach for predicting B-cell epitopes.url: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0161589008006603public_in: 《Molecular Immunology》authors: ND Rubinstein,I Mayrose,T Pupko,abstract: The immune activity of an antibody is directed against a specific region on its target antigen known as the epitope. Numerous immunodetection and immunotheraputics applications are based on the ability of antibodies to recognize epitopes. The detection of immunogenic regions is often an essential step in these applications. The experimental approaches used for detecting immunogenic regions are often laborious and resource-intensive. Thus, computational methods for the prediction of immunogenic regions alleviate this drawback by guiding the experimental procedures. In this work we developed a computational method for the prediction of immunogenic regions from either the protein three-dimensional structure or sequence when the structure is unavailable. The method implements a machine-learning algorithm that was trained to recognize immunogenic patterns based on a large benchmark dataset of validated epitopes derived from antigen structures and sequences. We compare our method to other available tools that perform the same task and show that it outperforms them.citations_number: 89Citation: Prediction of Antimicrobial Peptides Based on Sequence Alignment and Feature Selection Methods "Ping Wang" "Lele Hu" "Guiyou Liu" "Nan Jiang" "Xiaoyun Chen" "Jianyong Xu" "Wen Zheng" "Li Li" "Ming Tan" "Zugen Chen" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=cc4ea119833f0284f4e350b9b85887a1EPSVR and EPMeta: prediction of antigenic epitopes using support vector regression and multiple server results "Yao Bo" "Standley Daron M" "Zheng Dandan" "Liang Shide" "Zacharias Martin" "Zhang Chi" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=6ac1bc6ef6d60725fdbcaf2d13f9654bPrediction of conformational B-cell epitopes from 3D structures by random forests with a distance-based feature "Wen Zhang" "Yi Xiong" "Meng Zhao" "Hua Zou" "Xinghuo Ye" "Juan Liu" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d9ff2426fe02a2d8b6ae3c5c6d099f6ePrediction of antigenic epitopes on protein surfaces by consensus scoring "Shide Liang" "Dandan Zheng" "Chi Zhang" "Martin Zacharias" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=21b842975f92114f1a97a8c2754795cdBEST: Improved Prediction of B-Cell Epitopes from Antigen Sequences "Gao J" "Faraggi E" "Zhou Y" "Ruan J" "Kurgan L" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=d60cccb823ad2e2b29861ffca13a2d2cThe Structural Basis of Antibody-Antigen Recognition "SelaCulang, Inbal" "Kunik, Vered" "Ofran, Yanay" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=44c2a77bf3669ef7106a15c165b6d111Removal of B cell epitopes as a practical approach for reducing the immunogenicity of foreign protein-based therapeutics "Nagata S" "Pastan I" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=64da10b54b820378958d788c2fc2a660Prediction of lysine ubiquitination with mRMR feature selection and analysis "Yudong Cai" "Tao Huang" "Lele Hu" "Xiaohe Shi" "Lu Xie" "Yixue Li" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=8bf513a33db3473181493eaa78fd0846SVM-based prediction of linear B-cell epitopes using Bayes Feature Extraction "Lawrence JK Wee" "Diane Simarmata" "YiuWing Kam" "Lisa FP Ng" "Joo Chuan Tong" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=77d36d37636a173282d441bcb7e5cd5aReferences: Procedures for Detecting Outlying Observations in Samples "Frank E.
