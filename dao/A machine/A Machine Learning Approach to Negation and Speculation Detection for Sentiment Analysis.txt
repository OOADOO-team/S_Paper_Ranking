Cruz,Maite Taboada,Ruslan Mitkov,abstract: Recognizing negative and speculative information ishighly relevant for sentiment analysis. This paper presentsa machine-learning approach to automaticallydetect this kind of information in the review domain. Theresulting system works in two steps: in the first pass,negation/speculation cues are identified, and in thesecond phase the full scope of these cues is determined.The system is trained and evaluated on the SimonFraser University Review corpus, which is extensivelyused in opinion mining. The results show how the proposedmethod outstrips the baseline by as much asroughly 20% in the negation cue detection and around13% in the scope recognition, both in terms of F1. Inspeculation, the performance obtained in the cue predictionphase is close to that obtained by a human ratercarrying out the same task. In the scope detection, theresults are also promising and represent a substantialimprovement on the baseline (up by roughly 10%). Adetailed error analysis is also provided. The extrinsicevaluation shows that the correct identification of cuesand scopes is vital for the task of sentiment analysis.citations_number: 20Citation: A machine-learning approach to negation and speculation detection for sentiment analysis "Noa P.
