name: Image-based crystal detection: a machine-learning approachurl: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19018095public_in: 《Acta Crystallographica》authors: Liu Roy,Freund Yoav,Spraggon Glen,abstract: The ability of computers to learn from and annotate large databases of crystallization-trial images provides not only the ability to reduce the workload of crystallization studies, but also an opportunity to annotate crystallization trials as part of a framework for improving screening methods. Here, a system is presented that scores sets of images based on the likelihood of containing crystalline material as perceived by a machine-learning algorithm. The system can be incorporated into existing crystallization-analysis pipelines, whereby specialists examine images as they normally would with the exception that the images appear in rank order according to a simple real-valued score. Promising results are shown for 319  112 images associated with 150 structures solved by the Joint Center for Structural Genomics pipeline during the 2006â2007 year. Overall, the algorithm achieves a mean receiver operating characteristic score of 0.919 and a 78% reduction in human effort per set when considering an absolute score cutoff for screening images, while incurring a loss of five out of 150  structures.citations_number: 17Citation: Nonlinear optical imaging of integral membrane protein crystals in lipidic mesophases.
