name: A Machine Learning Approach to Assessing Knowledge Sharing During Collaborative Learning Activitiesurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/2495163_A_Machine_Learning_Approach_to_Assessing_Knowledge_Sharing_During_Collaborative_Learning_Activitiespublic_in: Proceedings of Computer-Support for Collaborative Learning, CSCL2002authors: Amy Soller Janyce Wiebe Alan Lesgold,abstract: ABSTRACT  Students bring to a collaborative learning situation a great deal of specialized knowledge and experiences that undoubtedly shape the collaboration and learning processes. How effectively this unique knowledge is shared and assimilated by the group affects both the process and the product of the collaboration. In this paper, we describe a machine learning approach, Hidden Markov Modeling, to analyzing and assessing on-line knowledge sharing conversations. We show that this approach can determine the effectiveness of knowledge sharing episodes with 93% accuracy, performing 43% over the baseline. Understanding how members of collaborative learning groups share, assimilate, and build knowledge together may help us identify situations in which facilitation may increase the effectiveness of the group interaction.citations_number: 76Citation: Designing for interaction: Six steps to designing computer-supported group-based learning "J.W.
