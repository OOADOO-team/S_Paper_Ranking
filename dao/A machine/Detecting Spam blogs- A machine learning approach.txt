name: Detecting Spam blogs: A machine learning approachurl: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/221606020_Detecting_Spam_Blogs_A_Machine_Learning_Approachpublic_in: National Conference on Association for Advancement of Artificial Intelligenceauthors: Pranam Kolari,Akshay Java,Tim Finin,abstract: Abstract Weblogs or blogs are an important new way to publish information, engage in discussions, and form commu- nities on the Internet. The Blogosphere has unfortu- nately been infected by several varieties of spam-like content. Blog search engines, for example, are inun- dated by posts from splogs - false blogs with machine generated or hijacked content whose sole purpose is to host ads or raise the PageRank of target sites. We dis- cuss how SVM models based on local and link-based features can be used to detect splogs. We present an evaluation of learned models and their utility to blog search engines; systems that employ techniques differ- ing from those of conventional web search engines.citations_number: 70Citation: Spotting fake reviewer groups in consumer reviews "Arjun Mukherjee" "Bing Liu" "Natalie Glance" http://xueshu.baidu.com/usercenter/paper/show?paperid=b30fd40f9a059d669f3f7a9ca6226630A review of machine learning approaches to Spam filtering "Thiago S.
